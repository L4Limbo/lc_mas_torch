Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe shortage (deficiency) of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, E, and K). The signs and symptoms of this condition primarily affect the gastrointestinal system, eyes, nervous system, and blood. The first signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia appear in infancy. They often include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); diarrhea; and fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea). As an individual with this condition ages, additional signs and symptoms include disturbances in nerve function that may lead to poor muscle coordination and difficulty with balance and movement (ataxia). They can also experience a loss of certain reflexes, impaired speech (dysarthria), tremors or other involuntary movements (motor tics), a loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy), or muscle weakness. The muscle problems can disrupt skeletal development, leading to an abnormally curved lower back (lordosis), a rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis), high-arched feet (pes cavus), or an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot). Individuals with this condition may also develop an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, in which breakdown of the light-sensitive layer (retina) at the back of the eye can cause vision loss. In individuals with abetalipoproteinemia, the retinitis pigmentosa can result in complete vision loss. People with abetalipoproteinemia may also have other eye problems, including involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus), and weakness of the external muscles of the eye (ophthalmoplegia). Individuals with abetalipoproteinemia usually have a low number of red blood cells (anemia) with abnormally star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis) and have difficulty forming blood clots, which can cause abnormal bleeding. In some cases, a condition called fatty liver develops, which can cause liver damage. Frequency Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare disorder. More than 100 cases have been described worldwide. Causes Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by mutations in the MTTP gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. This protein is essential for creating molecules called beta-lipoproteins in the liver and intestine. Beta-lipoproteins transport fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the intestine to the bloodstream so these nutrients can be taken up by tissues throughout the body. Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal growth, development, and maintenance of the body's cells and tissues. Most MTTP gene mutations lead to the production of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein with reduced or absent function and unable to help in the formation of beta-lipoproteins. A lack of beta-lipoproteins causes severely reduced absorption (malabsorption) of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. These nutritional deficiencies lead to health problems in people with abetalipoproteinemia. Inheritance Pattern This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

                "document": " Asthma Overview Asthma is a chronic lung disease that causes episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, tightness in the chest, or coughing. After age 15, asthma is more common in girls and women than in boys and men. Women with asthma may have more symptoms during certain times in the menstrual cycle. Asthma may cause problems during pregnancy. You can help prevent or stop asthma attacks with medicine and by staying away from your asthma triggers, such as pollen, mold, or air pollution. What is asthma? Asthma is a chronic lung disease that affects the bronchial tubes. Your bronchial tubes carry air into and out of your lungs. When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen. The oxygen travels through your bloodstream to all parts of your body. In people who have asthma, the lungs and walls of the bronchial tubes become inflamed and oversensitive. When people with asthma breathe in \"asthma triggers,\" such as smoke, air pollution, cold air, mold, or chemicals, the bronchial tubes tighten in response. This limits airflow and makes it difficult to breathe. Asthma triggers may be different for each person and may change over time. Who gets asthma? Before age 15, asthma affects more boys than girls. After age 15, asthma is more common among girls and women than among boys and men. Researchers believe the hormones estrogen and progesterone might affect women's airways. Changing hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle and during pregnancy and menopause may affect airways in women with asthma.1 Some women are more at risk for asthma: How does asthma affect women? Studies show that asthma may affect women differently than men.4 What are the symptoms of asthma? Asthma symptoms include: You may have only one or two of these symptoms, or you may get all of them. You may also get asthma symptoms only at night or in cold weather. Or you may get asthma symptoms after exposure to an allergen or other trigger, or when you have a cold or are exercising. How is asthma diagnosed? Many people develop asthma during childhood, but asthma can happen at any age. Asthma can be difficult to diagnose. Asthma symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, bronchitis, anxiety disorders, and heart disease. To diagnose asthma, your doctor or nurse may: Your doctor or nurse may also do tests including: Your doctor or nurse may want to test for other problems that might be causing your symptoms. These include sleep apnea, vocal cord problems, or stomach acid backing up into the throat. How is asthma treated? Asthma is a chronic disease. This means that it can be treated but not cured. However, some people are able to manage asthma so that symptoms do not happen again or happen rarely. You can take steps to control asthma and prevent problems by: What is an asthma action plan? Your doctor or nurse will work with you to come up with an action plan for treating your asthma. The action plan includes: What types of medicines treat asthma? Asthma medicines work by opening the lung airways or by reducing the inflammation in the lungs. Some asthma medicines are pills, but most come from an inhaler (you breathe the medicine in). Asthma medicines fall into two groups: long-term control medicines and quick-relief or \"rescue\" medicines. Long-term control medicines help you have fewer and less severe asthma attacks. But they don't work to stop an asthma attack that has already started. You take long-term control medicines every day to relieve inflammation and help open the airways. Common types of long-term control medicines include inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists. Inhaled corticosteroids help reduce inflammation in the lungs so that you are less likely to have an asthma attack. They will probably be the first type of long-term asthma control medicine your doctor will give you. If your asthma is not controlled with an inhaled corticosteroid, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves adding a long-acting beta agonist to your long-term control treatment. Beta agonists help open your airways but you should only use long-acting beta agonists alongside an inhaled corticosteroid. Quick-relief or \"rescue\" medicines help stop attacks once they start. Quick-relief medicines include short-acting inhaled beta agonists like albuterol. Quick-relief medicines usually make your symptoms go away within minutes. They do this by quickly relaxing tightened muscles around the airways. Are complementary or alternative therapies safe to treat asthma? Research has not shown complementary (add-on) or alternative treatments to stop an asthma attack or prevent asthma symptoms. More research is needed about whether complementary or alternative therapies work or are safe for asthma treatment. What are common asthma triggers? Many different things can trigger an asthma attack. And what triggers one person's asthma may not trigger another person's asthma. Common asthma triggers include: How can I prevent an asthma attack? You can take medicines to help prevent and stop asthma attacks. You can also help prevent attacks by staying away from asthma triggers and following these steps:5 How does my menstrual cycle affect asthma? Changing hormone levels throughout your menstrual cycle may make your asthma symptoms worse during some parts of the cycle. If your asthma symptoms get worse during certain parts of your cycle every month, track your symptoms and menstrual cycle on a calendar. After a few months, you might be able to predict when your asthma symptoms will flare up based on your menstrual cycle. You can then stay away from other asthma triggers during these times. Tell your doctor or nurse: How does asthma affect pregnancy? Many women who have asthma do not have any problems during pregnancy. But asthma can cause problems for you and your baby during pregnancy because of changing hormone levels. Your unborn baby depends on the air you breathe in for oxygen. Asthma attacks during pregnancy can prevent your unborn baby from getting enough oxygen. Pregnant women with asthma have a higher risk for:7 Pregnancy may also make asthma symptoms seem worse due to acid reflux or heartburn. If you have asthma and are thinking about becoming pregnant, talk to your doctor or nurse. Having your asthma under control before you get pregnant can help prevent problems during pregnancy. Is asthma medicine safe to take during pregnancy? Some asthma medicines may be safe to take during pregnancy. Talk to your doctor or nurse about whether it is safe to continue taking your medicine during pregnancy. Your doctor or nurse may suggest a different medicine to take. Don't stop taking your medicine or change your medicine without talking to your doctor or nurse first. Not using medicine that you need may be more harmful to you and your baby than using the medicine. Untreated asthma can cause serious problems during pregnancy. Also, talk with your doctor or nurse about getting a flu shot. The flu can be very dangerous for women with asthma, especially during pregnancy when your immune system is different from normal. How does menopause affect asthma? For some women, asthma symptoms do not change after menopause.8 However, other women report that their asthma symptoms get better after menopause. Researchers think very low levels of estrogen after menopause may be a reason why asthma symptoms can get better and why fewer women develop asthma after menopause. This may also explain why women who take menopausal hormone therapy for menopause symptoms are at higher risk for developing asthma.8 Did we answer your question about asthma?

                "document": " Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness autosomal recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness autosomal recessive incomplete congenital stationary night blindness Description Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Frequency Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown. Causes Mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments. Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown. Inheritance Pattern This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

                "document": " Cystic fibrosis Overview Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in people with cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas. Although cystic fibrosis requires daily care, people with the condition are usually able to attend school and work, and often have a better quality of life than people with cystic fibrosis had in previous decades. Improvements in screening and treatments mean people with cystic fibrosis now may live into their mid- to late 30s, on average, and some are living into their 40s and 50s. Cystic fibrosis care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms Screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis is now performed in every state in the United States. As a result, the condition can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. For people born before newborn screening was performed, it's important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis affect the respiratory system and digestive system. However, adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia. The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as: - A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum) - Wheezing - Breathlessness - Exercise intolerance - Repeated lung infections - Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren't able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often: - Foul-smelling, greasy stools - Poor weight gain and growth - Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus) - Severe constipation Frequent straining while passing stool can cause part of the rectum - the end of the large intestine - to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse). When this occurs in children, it may be a sign of cystic fibrosis. Parents should consult a physician knowledgeable about cystic fibrosis. Rectal prolapse in children may sometimes require surgery. Rectal prolapse in children with cystic fibrosis is less common than it was in the past, which may be due to earlier testing, diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis. If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis - or if someone in your family has cystic fibrosis - talk with your doctor about testing for the disease. Seek immediate medical care if you or your child has difficulty breathing. Causes In cystic fibrosis, a defect (mutation) in a gene changes a protein that regulates the movement of salt in and out of cells. The result is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as increased salt in sweat. Many different defects can occur in the gene. The type of gene mutation is associated with the severity of the condition. Children need to inherit one copy of the gene from each parent in order to have the disease. If children inherit only one copy, they won't develop cystic fibrosis. However, they will be carriers and possibly pass the gene to their own children. Risk factors - Family history. Because cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder, it runs in families. - Race. Although cystic fibrosis occurs in all races, it is most common in white people of Northern European ancestry. Complications - Damaged airways (bronchiectasis). Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of bronchiectasis, a condition that damages the airways. This makes it harder to move air in and out of the lungs and clear mucus from the airways (bronchial tubes). - Chronic infections. Thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses provides an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. People with cystic fibrosis may often have sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia. - Growths in the nose (nasal polyps). Because the lining inside the nose is inflamed and swollen, it can develop soft, fleshy growths (polyps). - Coughing up blood (hemoptysis). Over time, cystic fibrosis can cause thinning of the airway walls. As a result, teenagers and adults with cystic fibrosis may cough up blood. - Pneumothorax. This condition, in which air collects in the space that separates the lungs from the chest wall, also is more common in older people with cystic fibrosis. Pneumothorax can cause chest pain and breathlessness. - Respiratory failure. Over time, cystic fibrosis can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works. Lung function usually worsens gradually, and it eventually can become life-threatening. - Acute exacerbations. People with cystic fibrosis may experience worsening of their respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath, for several days to weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation and requires treatment in the hospital. - Nutritional deficiencies. Thick mucus can block the tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your intestines. Without these enzymes, your body can't absorb protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins. - Diabetes. The pancreas produces insulin, which your body needs to use sugar. Cystic fibrosis increases the risk of diabetes. Around 30 percent of people with cystic fibrosis develop diabetes by age 30. - Blocked bile duct. The tube that carries bile from your liver and gallbladder to your small intestine may become blocked and inflamed, leading to liver problems and sometimes gallstones. - Intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction can happen to people with cystic fibrosis at all ages. Children and adults with cystic fibrosis are more likely than are infants to develop intussusception, a condition in which a section of the intestines folds in on itself like an accordion. - Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). DIOS is partial or complete obstruction where the small intestine meets the large intestine. Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are infertile because the tube that connects the testes and prostate gland (vas deferens) is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely. Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with cystic fibrosis to become biological fathers. Although women with cystic fibrosis may be less fertile than other women, it's possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies. Still, pregnancy can worsen the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis, so be sure to discuss the possible risks with your doctor. - Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). People with cystic fibrosis are at higher risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones. - Electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. Because people with cystic fibrosis have saltier sweat, the balance of minerals in their blood may be upset. Signs and symptoms include increased heart rate, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure. Diagnosis To diagnose cystic fibrosis, doctors may conduct several tests. Newborn screening and diagnosis Every state in the U.S. now routinely screens newborns for cystic fibrosis. Early diagnosis means treatment can begin immediately. In one screening test, a blood sample is checked for higher than normal levels of a chemical (immunoreactive trypsinogen, or IRT) released by the pancreas. A newborn's IRT levels may be high because of premature birth or a stressful delivery. For that reason other tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Genetic tests may be used in addition to checking the IRT levels to confirm the diagnosis. Doctors may also conduct genetic tests to test for specific defects on the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. To evaluate if an infant has cystic fibrosis, doctors may also conduct a sweat test when the infant is at least 2 weeks old. In a sweat test, doctors apply a sweat-producing chemical to a small area of skin. They then collect the sweat to test it and see if it's saltier than normal. Testing may be done at a center specializing in cystic fibrosis. Testing of older children and adults Cystic fibrosis tests may be recommended for older children and adults who weren't screened at birth. Your doctor may suggest genetic and sweat tests for cystic fibrosis if you have recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), nasal polyps, chronic sinus or lung infections, bronchiectasis, or male infertility. Treatment There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but treatment can ease symptoms and reduce complications. Close monitoring and early, aggressive intervention is recommended. Managing cystic fibrosis is complex, so consider obtaining treatment at a center staffed by doctors and other staff trained in cystic fibrosis. Doctors may work with a multidisciplinary team of doctors and medical professionals trained in cystic fibrosis to evaluate and treat your condition. The goals of treatment include: - Preventing and controlling infections that occur in the lungs - Removing and loosening mucus from the lungs - Treating and preventing intestinal blockage - Providing adequate nutrition Medications The options may include: - Antibiotics to treat and prevent lung infections - Anti-inflammatory medications to lessen swelling in the airways in your lungs - Mucus-thinning drugs to help you cough up the mucus, which can improve lung function - Inhaled medications called bronchodilators that can help keep your airways open by relaxing the muscles around your bronchial tubes - Oral pancreatic enzymes to help your digestive tract absorb nutrients For those with cystic fibrosis who have certain gene mutations, doctors may recommend a newer medication called ivacaftor (Kalydeco). This medication may improve lung function and weight, and reduce the amount of salt in sweat. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people with cystic fibrosis who are age 6 and older. The dose depends on your weight and age. Doctors may conduct liver function tests and eye examinations before prescribing ivacaftor and on a regular basis while you're taking it to check for side effects such as liver function abnormalities and cataracts. For people with a certain gene mutation who are age 12 and older, another drug (Orkambi) is available that combines ivacaftor with a medication called lumacaftor. The combination of these medications may improve lung function and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, some people may experience side effects such as chest discomfort and shortness of breath soon after starting the medication. Some people may also have high blood pressure while taking the medication. Doctors may monitor you for any side effects. Chest physical therapy Loosening the thick mucus in the lungs makes it easier to cough up. Chest physical therapy helps loosen mucus. It is usually done from one to four times a day. A common technique is clapping with cupped hands on the front and back of the chest. Certain breathing techniques also may be used to help loosen the mucus. Your doctor will instruct you about the type of chest physical therapy he or she recommends for you. Mechanical devices also can help loosen lung mucus. These include a vibrating vest or a tube or mask you breathe into. Pulmonary rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend a long-term program that may improve your lung function and overall well-being. Pulmonary rehabilitation is usually done on an outpatient basis and may include: - Physical exercise that may improve your condition - Breathing techniques that may help loosen mucus and improve breathing - Nutritional counseling - Counseling and support - Education about your condition Surgical and other procedures - Nasal polyp removal. Your doctor may recommend surgery to remove nasal polyps that obstruct breathing. - Oxygen therapy. If your blood oxygen level declines, your doctor may recommend that you breathe pure oxygen to prevent high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). - Endoscopy and lavage. Mucus may be suctioned from obstructed airways through an endoscope. - Feeding tube. Cystic fibrosis interferes with digestion, so you can't absorb nutrients from food very well. Your doctor may suggest temporarily using a feeding tube to deliver extra nutrition while you sleep. This tube may be inserted in your nose and guided to your stomach, or it may be surgically implanted into the abdomen. - Bowel surgery. If a blockage develops in your bowel, you may need surgery to remove it. Intussusception, where a section of bowel has folded in on itself, also may require surgical repair. - Lung transplant. If you have severe breathing problems, life-threatening lung complications or increasing resistance to antibiotics used to treat lung infections, lung transplantation may be an option. Because bacteria line the airways in diseases that cause permanent widening of the large airways (bronchiectasis), such as cystic fibrosis, both lungs need to be replaced. Cystic fibrosis does not recur in transplanted lungs. However, other complications associated with cystic fibrosis - such as sinus infections, diabetes, pancreas problems and osteoporosis - can still occur after a lung transplant. Lifestyle and home remedies You can manage your condition and minimize complications in several ways. Always talk to your doctor before starting home remedies. Cystic fibrosis can cause malnourishment because the enzymes needed for digestion can't reach your small intestine, preventing food from being absorbed. People with cystic fibrosis may need a significantly higher number of calories daily than do people without the condition. A healthy diet is important to maintain good lung function. It's also important to drink lots of fluids, which can help thin the mucus in your lungs. You may work with a dietitian to develop a nutrition plan. Most people with cystic fibrosis need to take pancreatic enzyme capsules with every meal and snack. In addition, your doctor may recommend: - Antacids - Supplemental high-calorie nutrition - Special fat-soluble vitamins - Extra fiber to prevent intestinal blockage - Extra salt, especially during hot weather or before exercising - Adequate water during hot weather In addition to other usual childhood vaccines, people with cystic fibrosis should have the annual flu vaccine and any other vaccines their doctor recommends. Cystic fibrosis doesn't affect the immune system, but children with cystic fibrosis are more likely to develop complications when they become sick. Regular exercise helps loosen mucus in your airways, and strengthens your heart. For many people with cystic fibrosis, participating in sports can improve confidence and self-esteem. Anything that gets you moving, including walking and biking, can help. Don't smoke in your home or car, and don't allow other people to smoke around you or your child. Secondhand smoke is harmful for everyone, but especially for people with cystic fibrosis. Teach all the members of your family to wash their hands thoroughly before eating, after using the bathroom, when coming home from work or school, and after being around a person who is sick. Hand-washing is the best way to protect against infection. You'll have ongoing care from your doctor and other medical professionals. Make sure to attend your regular follow-up appointments. Take your medications as prescribed and follow therapies as instructed. Contact your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms such as severe constipation, more mucus than usual, blood in your mucus or reduced energy. ",

                "document": " Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome or Fragile X Martin-Bell syndrome Overview The genetic disorder Fragile X syndrome, which results from mutations in a gene on the X chromosome, is the most commonly inherited form of developmental and intellectual disability. The NICHD supports and conducts research on the diagnosis, treatment, management, prevention, and inheritance of Fragile X and its associated conditions, Fragile X-Associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI) and Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). All three conditions result from changes in the same gene on the X chromosome. Condition Information What is Fragile X syndrome? Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects a person\u2019s development, especially that person\u2019s behavior and ability to learn. In addition, Fragile X can affect: - Communication skills - Physical appearance - Sensitivity to noise, light, or other sensory information Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) People with Fragile X syndrome may not have noticeable symptoms, or they can have more serious symptoms that range from learning disabilities to cognitive and behavior problems. How is FMR1 mutation related? \u00bb How is the FMR1 mutation related to Fragile X-associated disorders? Fragile X syndrome and its associated conditions are caused by changes (mutations) in the FMR1 gene found on the X chromosome. This mutation affects how the body makes the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which can cause the symptoms of Fragile X. In a gene, the information for making a protein has two parts: the introduction, and the instructions for making the protein itself. Researchers call the introduction the promoter because of how it helps to start the process of building the protein. The promoter part of the FMR1 gene includes many repeats\u2014repeated instances of a specific DNA sequence called the CGG sequence. A normal FMR1 gene has between 6 and 40 repeats in the promoter; the average is 30 repeats. People with between 55 and 200 repeats have a premutation of the gene. The premutation may cause the gene to not work properly, but it does not cause intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). The premutation is linked to the disorders FXPOI and FXTAS. However, not all people with the premutation show symptoms of FXPOI or FXTAS. People with 200 or more repeats in the promoter part of the gene have a full mutation, meaning the gene might not work at all. People with a full mutation often have Fragile X syndrome. The number of repeats, also called the \u201csize of the mutation,\u201d affects the type of symptoms and how serious the symptoms of Fragile X syndrome will be. Inheriting Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome is inherited, which means it is passed down from parents to children. Anyone with the FMR1 gene mutation can pass it to their children. However, a person who inherits the gene mutation may not develop Fragile X syndrome. Males will pass it down to all of their daughters and not their sons. Females have a 50/50 chance to pass it along to both their sons and daughters. In some cases, an FMR1 premutation can change to a full mutation when it is passed from parent to child. Read more about how FMR1 changes as it is passed from parent to child. \u00ab Condition Information What causes it? \u00bb What causes it? Fragile X results from a change or mutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which is found on the X chromosome. The gene normally makes a protein called Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. This protein is important for creating and maintaining connections between cells in the brain and nervous system. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which often causes the symptoms of Fragile X. Not everyone with the mutated FMR1 gene has symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, because the body may still be able to make FMRP. A few things affect how much FMRP the body can make: - The size of the mutation. Some people have a smaller mutation (a lower number of repeats) in their FMR1 gene, while others have big mutations (a large number of repeats) in the gene. If the mutation is small, the body may be able to make some of the protein. Having the protein available makes the symptoms milder. - The number of cells that have the mutation. Because not every cell in the body is exactly the same, some cells might have the FMR1 mutation while others do not. This situation is called mosaicism (pronounced moh-ZAY-uh-siz-uhm). If the mutation is in most of the body\u2019s cells, the person will probably have symptoms of Fragile X syndrome. If the mutation is in only some of the cells, the person might not have any symptoms at all or only mild symptoms. - Being female. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have only one. In females, if the FMR1 gene on one X chromosome has the mutation, the FMR1 gene on the other X chromosome might not have the mutation. Even if one of the female\u2019s genes has a very large mutation, the body can usually make at least some FMRP, leading to milder symptoms. \u00ab How is FMR1 mutation related? How many people are affected? \u00bb How many people are affected? About 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females have Fragile X syndrome. How many people have the Fragile X premutation? Although Fragile X syndrome is relatively rare, premutations in the FMR1 gene are relatively common: A recent study of 6,747 people found that 1 in 151 women and 1 in 468 men had the premutation. People with the premutation might not have any symptoms of Fragile X. However, the premutation can sometimes expand in the next generation, which can cause Fragile X syndrome. \u00ab What causes it? What are common symptoms \u00bb What are common symptoms? People with Fragile X do not all have the same signs and symptoms, but they do have some things in common. Symptoms are often milder in females than in males. - Intelligence and learning. Many people with Fragile X have problems with intellectual functioning. - These problems can range from the mild, such as learning disorders or problems with mathematics, to the severe, such as an intellectual or developmental disability. - The syndrome may affect the ability to think, reason, and learn. - Because many people with Fragile X also have attention disorders, hyperactivity, anxiety, and language-processing problems, a person with Fragile X may have more capabilities than his or her IQ (intelligence quotient) score suggests. - Physical. Most infants and younger children with Fragile X don\u2019t have any specific physical features of this syndrome. When these children start to go through puberty, however, many will begin to develop certain features that are typical of those with Fragile X. - These features include a narrow face, large head, large ears, flexible joints, flat feet, and a prominent forehead. - These physical signs become more obvious with age. - Behavioral, social, and emotional. Most children with Fragile X have some behavioral challenges. - They may be afraid or anxious in new situations. - They may have trouble making eye contact with other people. - Boys, especially, may have trouble paying attention or be aggressive. - Girls may be shy around new people. They may also have attention disorders and problems with hyperactivity. - Speech and language. Most boys with Fragile X have some problems with speech and language. - They may have trouble speaking clearly, may stutter, or may leave out parts of words. They may also have problems understanding other people\u2019s social cues, such as tone of voice or specific types of body language. - Girls usually do not have severe problems with speech or language. - Some children with Fragile X begin talking later than typically developing children. Most will talk eventually, but a few might stay nonverbal throughout their lives. - Sensory. Many children with Fragile X are bothered by certain sensations, such as bright light, loud noises, or the way certain clothing feels on their bodies. - These sensory issues might cause them to act out or display behavior problems. \u00ab How many people are affected? How is it diagnosed? \u00bb How is it diagnosed? Health care providers often use a blood sample to diagnose Fragile X. The health care provider will take a sample of blood and will send it to a laboratory, which will determine what form of the FMR1 gene is present. Prenatal Testing (During Pregnancy) Pregnant women who have an FMR1 premutation or full mutation may pass that mutated gene on to their children. A prenatal test allows health care providers to detect the mutated gene in the developing fetus. This important information helps families and providers to prepare for Fragile X syndrome and to intervene as early as possible. Possible types of prenatal tests include: - Amniocentesis (pronounced am-nee-oh-sen-TEE-sis). A health care provider takes a sample of amniotic (pronounced am-nee-OT-ik) fluid, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. - Chorionic villus (pronounced KOHR-ee-on-ik VILL-uhs) sampling. A health care provider takes a sample of cells from the placenta, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. Because prenatal testing involves some risk to the mother and fetus, if you or a family member is considering prenatal testing for Fragile X, discuss all the risks and benefits with your health care provider. Prenatal testing is not very common, and many parents do not know they carry the mutation. Therefore, parents usually start to notice symptoms in their children when they are infants or toddlers. The average age at diagnosis is 36 months for boys and 42 months for girls. Diagnosis of Children Many parents first notice symptoms of delayed development in their infants or toddlers. These symptoms may include delays in speech and language skills, social and emotional difficulties, and being sensitive to certain sensations. Children may also be delayed in or have problems with motor skills such as learning to walk. A health care provider can perform developmental screening to determine the nature of delays in a child. If a health care provider suspects the child has Fragile X syndrome, he/she can refer parents to a clinical geneticist, who can perform a genetic test for Fragile X syndrome. \u00ab What are common symptoms? What are the treatments? \u00bb \u200b\u200b What are the treatments? There is no single treatment for Fragile X syndrome, but there are treatments that help minimize the symptoms of the condition. Individuals with Fragile X who receive appropriate education, therapy services, and medications have the best chance of using all of their individual capabilities and skills. Even those with an intellectual or developmental disability can learn to master many self-help skills. Early intervention is important. Because a young child\u2019s brain is still forming, early intervention gives children the best start possible and the greatest chance of developing a full range of skills. The sooner a child with Fragile X syndrome gets treatment, the more opportunity there is for learning. \u00ab How is it diagnosed? Educational treatments \u00bb Other FAQs Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? Among the other conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome are the following: - Autism spectrum disorder. From 30% to 50% of people with Fragile X also meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder. - Mitral valve prolapse. In mitral valve prolapse (pronounced MY-truhl valv PROH-laps), a heart condition, the valve that separates the upper and lower left chambers of the heart does not work properly. This condition is usually not life-threatening, but in severe cases, surgery might be required to correct the problem. - Seizures. Between 6% and 20% of children with Fragile X syndrome have seizures. Seizures associated with the syndrome are more common in boys than in girls. [top] How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? The gene for Fragile X is carried on the X chromosome. Because both males (XY) and females (XX) have at least one X chromosome, both can pass on the mutated gene to their children. - A father with the altered gene for Fragile X on his X chromosome will pass that gene on only to his daughters. To his sons he will pass on a Y chromosome, which doesn\u2019t transmit Fragile X syndrome. Therefore, a father with the altered gene on his X chromosome and a mother with normal X chromosomes would have daughters with the altered gene for Fragile X, while none of their sons would have the mutated gene. - A father can pass on the premutation form of the FMR1 gene to his daughters but not the full mutation. Even if the father himself has a full mutation of this gene, it appears that sperm can carry only the premutation. Scientists don\u2019t understand how or why fathers can pass on only the milder form of Fragile X to their daughters. This remains an area of focused research. - Mothers pass on only X chromosomes to their children, so if a mother has the altered gene for Fragile X, she can pass that gene to either her sons or her daughters. If a mother has the mutated gene on one X chromosome and has one normal X chromosome, and the father has no mutations, all the children have a 50-50 chance of inheriting the mutated gene. - These 50-50 odds apply for each child the parents have. Having one child with the FMR1 mutation does not increase or decrease the chances of having another child with the mutated FMR1 gene. This is also true for the severity of the symptoms. Having one child with mild symptoms does not mean that the other children will have severe symptoms, and having a child with severe symptoms does not mean that the other children will have mild symptoms. [top] How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? The repeats in the promoter part of the FMR1 gene are unstable, and sometimes the number of repeats increases from one generation to the next. A premutation gene is less stable than a full mutation gene. So as it passes from parent to child, a premutation gene might expand to become a full mutation gene. The chances of expansion depend on the number of repeats in the promoter of the premutation gene: Normal FMR1 genes that have 5 to 44 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered normal. When these genes are passed from parent to child, the number of repeats does not increase or decrease. Intermediate FMR1 genes with 45 to 54 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered intermediate, or borderline. An intermediate gene may expand from one generation to the next, depending on which parent has the gene. Mother to Child About 14% of the time, when a mother passes an intermediate gene to her child, the CGG repeats increase to a number seen with premutations. Research shows that an intermediate gene will not become a full mutation gene in one generation, and so a mother with an intermediate gene will not have a child with a full mutation. Father to Child When intermediate genes are transmitted from father to child, they are generally stable and do not increase to premutations. Premutations Premutation (55 to 199 CGG repeats) FMR1 genes can expand to a full mutation from one generation to the next. The risk of expansion depends on which parent has the gene and the number of repeats in that gene. Mother to Child An FMR1 gene from the mother with 100 CGG repeats is very likely to expand to a full mutation when passed to the child. An FMR1 gene from the mother with 70 to 79 CGG repeats has about a 30% chance of expanding to a full mutation in one generation. Father to Child Premutations passed from father to child have almost no chance of expanding to full mutations. [top] \u00ab What are the Treatments? ",
