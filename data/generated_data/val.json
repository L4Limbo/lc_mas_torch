I just learned that this condition most likely caused the death of my first child back in 1971.  I was then told it was merely a fluke.  I had NO trauma during the full-term pregnancy, and I and my then husband were in very good health.  Now my son (from a different husband) and his wife are due to have fraternal twins in  2015.  Does the term 'congenital' mean that it could be passed down to another generation?  I do not want to alarm my son and his wife.  I just would like to inform whatever pediatrician is caring for these babies as to my experience.  Unfortunately my son and I are estranged.  And I do not know who is their pediatrician.  My child's CDH was very severe.  I know there are far less severe cases that can go undetected &/or undiagnosed unless there is a reason to suspect such a condition.  Please respond to my concerns.",

These medications - including donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Razadyne) - work by boosting levels of a chemical messenger involved in memory and judgment. Although primarily used to treat Alzheimer's disease, these medications might also be prescribed for other dementias, including vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia and Lewy body dementia. - Memantine. Memantine (Namenda) works by regulating the activity of glutamate, another chemical messenger involved in brain functions, such as learning and memory. In some cases, memantine is prescribed with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Several dementia symptoms and behavior problems might be treated initially using nondrug approaches, such as: - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can show you how to make your home safer and teach coping behaviors. The purpose is to prevent accidents, such as falls; manage behavior; and prepare you for the dementia progression. - Modifying the environment. Reducing clutter and noise can make it easier for someone with dementia to focus and function. You might need to hide objects that can threaten safety, such as knives and car keys. Monitoring systems can alert you if the person with dementia wanders. - Modifying tasks. Break tasks into easier steps and focus on success, not failure. Structure and routine also help reduce confusion in people with dementia.",

            "Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both. To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested: - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally - Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown. - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes. If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.",

            "Signs and symptoms of lupus may vary over time and overlap with those of many other disorders. No one test can diagnose lupus. The combination of blood and urine tests, signs and symptoms, and physical examination findings leads to the diagnosis. Laboratory tests Blood and urine tests may include: - Complete blood count. This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets as well as the amount of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Results may indicate you have anemia, which commonly occurs in lupus. A low white blood cell or platelet count may occur in lupus as well. - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate. This blood test determines the rate at which red blood cells settle to the bottom of a tube in an hour. A faster than normal rate may indicate a systemic disease, such as lupus. The sedimentation rate isn't specific for any one disease. It may be elevated if you have lupus, an infection, another inflammatory condition or cancer. - Kidney and liver assessment. Blood tests can assess how well your kidneys and liver are functioning. Lupus can affect these organs. - Urinalysis. An examination of a sample of your urine may show an increased protein level or red blood cells in the urine, which may occur if lupus has affected your kidneys. - Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. A positive test for the presence of these antibodies - produced by your immune system - indicates a stimulated immune system. While most people with lupus have a positive ANA test, most people with a positive ANA do not have lupus. If you test positive for ANA, your doctor may advise more-specific antibody testing. Imaging tests If your doctor suspects that lupus is affecting your lungs or heart, he or she may suggest: - Chest X-ray. An image of your chest may reveal abnormal shadows that suggest fluid or inflammation in your lungs. - Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to produce real-time images of your beating heart. It can check for problems with your valves and other portions of your heart. Biopsy Lupus can harm your kidneys in many different ways, and treatments can vary, depending on the type of damage that occurs. In some cases, it's necessary to test a small sample of kidney tissue to determine what the best treatment might be. The sample can be obtained with a needle or through a small incision. Skin biopsy is sometimes performed to confirm a diagnosis of lupus affecting the skin.",

            "The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale. Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by: - Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis - Birth defects of the heart - Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism) - Heart failure - Heart valve disease - HIV infection - Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic) - Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis - Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs) - Obstructive sleep apnea",
            "Pulmonary Hypertension PH has many causes, so many tests may need to be done to find its underlying cause.",
            "Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.",
            "Pulmonary arterial hypertension is usually sporadic, which means it occurs in individuals with no known family history of the disorder. These non-familial cases are described as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. About 20 percent of these cases are caused by mutations in one of the genes known to be associated with the disease, but most of the time a causative gene mutation has not been identified.",
            "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH.",

            "Heart attack (Treatment): Heart attack treatment at a hospital With each passing minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue loses oxygen and deteriorates or dies. The main way to prevent heart damage is to restore blood flow quickly. Aspirin. The 911 operator may instruct you to take aspirin, or emergency medical personnel may give you aspirin immediately. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. Emergency room doctors may give you other drugs to help prevent new clots and keep existing clots from getting larger. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack: - Coronary angioplasty and stenting. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that's passed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. If you've had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to locate blockages. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon that, once in position, is briefly inflated to open a blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. In some cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, your doctor may suggest that you have bypass surgery after your heart has had time - about three to seven days - to recover from your heart attack.",
            "Heart attack (Treatment): IMMEDIATE TREATMENT - You will be hooked up to a heart monitor, so the health care team can see how regularly your heart is beating. - You will receive oxygen so that your heart doesn't have to work as hard. - An intravenous line (IV) will be placed into one of your veins. Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment.",
            "The following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack: - Avoid smoke. The most important thing you can do to improve your heart's health is to not smoke. Also, avoid being around secondhand smoke. - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If one or both of these is high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications. Ask your doctor how often you need to have your blood pressure and cholesterol levels monitored. - Get regular medical checkups. Some of the major risk factors for heart attack - high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes - cause no symptoms early on. Exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function after a heart attack and helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to control your weight, diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure.  Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Eat a heart-healthy diet. Saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart, and too much salt can raise blood pressure. Control stress. Reduce stress in your day-to-day activities.

            "Hemophilia A (Treatment): People with inherited hemophilia A require life-long care, preferably through a specialized hemophilia treatment center. Although there is no cure for hemophilia A, current treatments usually work well. Treatment primarily consists of replacing the missing clotting factor VIII ( replacement therapy) and preventing complications that are associated with the disorder. The type and frequency of treatment often depends on the severity of the disorder in each person. People with mild or moderate hemophilia A may be treated with replacement therapy as needed (for example, when a specific bleeding episode occurs). This is called episodic therapy. Some people with mild hemophilia A may be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). Desmopressin raises the levels of factor VIII in the blood and may be taken intravenously or through a nasal spray. Drugs known as antifibrinolytics, which slow the breakdown of clotting factors in the blood, can also be used to treat those with a mild form of the disorder. Some people with severe hemophilia A may receive periodic factor VIII infusions to prevent bleeding episodes and associated complications such as joint damage.",
            "Hemophilia A (Treatment): Treatment includes replacing the missing clotting factor. You will receive factor VIII concentrates. How much you get depends on: - Severity of bleeding - Site of bleeding - Your weight and height Mild hemophilia may be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). This medicine helps the body release factor VIII that is stored within the lining of blood vessels. To prevent a bleeding crisis, people with hemophilia and their families can be taught to give factor VIII concentrates at home at the first signs of bleeding. People with severe forms of the disease may need regular preventive treatment. DDAVP or factor VIII concentrate may also be needed before having dental extractions or surgery. You should get the hepatitis B vaccine. People with hemophilia are more likely to get hepatitis B because they may receive blood products.",
            "Hemophilia (Treatment): The most common treatment is to replace the missing clotting factor in the blood through a vein (intravenous infusions). Special care during surgery needs to be taken if you have this bleeding disorder. So, be sure to tell your surgeon that you have this disorder. It is also very important to share information about your disorder with blood relatives as they may also be affected.",
            "The main treatment for hemophilia is called replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that's missing or low. Clotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases, such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small. To further reduce the risk, you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that aren't made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store, mix, and use at home?it only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor. You may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic (PRO-fih-lac-tik) therapy. Or, you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment, on an as-needed basis, is called demand therapy. Demand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However, there's a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy.",

Most of the identified mutations reduce the amount or function of the protein that is produced from a specific gene, which likely impairs the normal formation of structures in the heart. Studies have also suggested that having more or fewer copies of particular genes compared with other people, a phenomenon known as copy number variation, may play a role in CCHD. Potential risk factors that have been studied include exposure to certain chemicals or drugs before birth, viral infections (such as rubella and influenza) that occur during pregnancy, and other maternal illnesses including diabetes and phenylketonuria.

            "Many studies have shown that an epidural is a safe way to manage pain during childbirth. While rare, there are some risks. Your blood pressure may drop for a short while. This might cause the baby's heart rate to slow down. - To avoid this, you will receive fluids through an intravenous (IV) line to help keep your blood pressure stable. - If your blood pressure shows a drop, you may need to lie on your side to keep the blood moving throughout your body. - Your provider may also give you medicine to raise your blood pressure. An epidural block may change or alter labor and delivery. - If you are very numb from the block, you may have a harder time bearing down to push your baby through the birth canal. - Contractions may lessen or slow down for a little while, but labor will still move along as it should. In some cases, it may even go faster. If your labor slows down, your doctor can give you medicine to speed up your contractions. It is best to wait until you are in active labor to have the epidural placed.

At the same time, stopping tobacco use causes withdrawal symptoms, including irritability and anxiety. Nicotine is very addictive when delivered by inhaling tobacco smoke into the lungs, which quickly releases nicotine into the blood allowing it to get into the brain within seconds of taking a puff. In the brain nicotine increases the release of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help regulate mood and behavior. Dopamine, one of these neurotransmitters, is released in the \"reward center\" of the brain and causes improved mood and feelings of pleasure. Experiencing these effects from nicotine is what makes tobacco so addictive. Nicotine dependence involves behavioral (routines, habits, feelings) as well as physical factors.",

Some forms of talk therapy can help you understand what causes your anxiety. This allows you to gain better control over it. Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, your behaviors, and your symptoms. Often CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to: - Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people's behavior or life events. - Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control. - Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur. - Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones. Your provider can discuss talk therapy options with you.",
            "Social anxiety disorder (Treatment): The goal of treatment is to help you function effectively. The success of the treatment usually depends on the severity of your fears. Behavioral treatment is often tried first and may have long-lasting benefits: - Cognitive behavioral therapy helps you understand and change the thoughts that are causing your condition, as well as learn to recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts. - Systematic desensitization or exposure therapy may be used. You are asked to relax, then imagine the situations that cause the anxiety, working from the least fearful to the most fearful. Gradual exposure to the real-life situation has also been used with success to help people overcome their fears. - Social skills training may involve social contact in a group therapy situation to practice social skills. Role playing and modeling are techniques used to help you become more comfortable relating to others in a social situation. Certain medicines, usually used to treat depression, may be very helpful for this disorder. They work by preventing your symptoms or making them less severe. Lifestyle changes may help reduce how often the attacks occur. - Get regular exercise, enough sleep, and regularly scheduled meals. - Reduce or avoid the use of caffeine, some over-the-counter cold medicines, and other stimulants.",

Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment.

This is because binging and purging is most often done in private. However, family or friends may see empty food wrappers in unexpected places or vomit in the home. People with bulimia often have other mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, or substance abuse.",

During these episodes, the person feels a lack of control over the eating. Binges lead to self-disgust, which causes purging to prevent weight gain. Purging may include: - Forcing oneself to vomit - Excessive exercise - Using laxatives, enemas, or diuretics (water pills) Purging often brings a sense of relief. People with bulimia are often at a normal weight, but they may see themselves as being overweight. Because the person's weight is often normal, other people may not notice this eating disorder. Symptoms that other people can see include: - Spending a lot of time exercising - Suddenly eating large amounts of food or buying large amounts of food that disappear right away - Regularly going to the bathroom right after meals - Throwing away packages of laxatives, diet pills, emetics (drugs that cause vomiting), or diuretics",

If left untreated, bulimia can severely impact your health. Talk to your primary care provider or a mental health provider about your bulimia symptoms and feelings.  If you're reluctant to seek treatment, confide in someone about what you're going through, whether it's a friend or loved one, a teacher, a faith leader, or someone else you trust.",
            "People with bulimia may secretly binge - eating large amounts of food - and then purge, trying to get rid of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. For example, someone with bulimia may force vomiting or engage in excessive exercise. Sometimes people purge after eating only a small snack or a normal-size meal. Bulimia can be categorized in two ways: - Purging bulimia. You regularly self-induce vomiting or misuse laxatives, diuretics or enemas after bingeing. - Nonpurging bulimia. You use other methods to rid yourself of calories and prevent weight gain, such as fasting, strict dieting or excessive exercise. However, these behaviors often overlap, and the attempt to rid yourself of extra calories is usually referred to as purging, no matter what the method. If you have bulimia, you're probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape. You may judge yourself severely and harshly for self-perceived flaws. Because it's related to self-image - and not just about food - bulimia can be hard to overcome.",

When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension.",

            "Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form.This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.",

These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. As the pressure builds, your heart's lower right chamber (right ventricle) must work harder to pump blood through your lungs, eventually causing your heart muscle to weaken and fail.",

For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH.",

Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 3 includes PH associated with lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial (IN-ter-STISH-al) lung diseases.

Talk with your health care professional about any of the health conditions listed above that may require medical treatment. Managing these health problems may help reduce your chances of developing type 2 diabetes. Also, ask your health care professional about any medicines you take that might increase your risk.",
            "Certain factors can increase your risk for diabetes, and its important to know what they are. Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. In an autoimmune reaction, antibodies, or immune cells, attach to the bodys own healthy tissues by mistake, signaling the body to attack them. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the cells, but many believe that both genetic factors and environmental factors, such as viruses, are involved. Studies are now underway to identify these factors and prevent type 1 diabetes in people at risk. Learn more about the causes of type 1 diabetes. Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes -- the most common form -- is linked closely to overweight and obesity, high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Many people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Being overweight can keep your body from using insulin properly. Genes also play an important role in a person's risk for type 2 diabetes. Having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. Here are the risk factors for type 2 diabetes. - being over 45 years of age - being overweight or obese - having a first-degree relative -- a parent, brother, or sister -- with diabetes - being African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian American or Pacific Islander, or Hispanic American/Latino. - having gestational diabetes, or giving birth to at least one baby weighing more than 9 pounds - having blood pressure of 140/90 or higher, or having been told that you have high blood pressure. - having abnormal cholesterol levels --",
            "Family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease.",

            "There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown. - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should.",
            "Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear, however, that certain factors increase the risk, including: - Weight. Being overweight is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes.  - Fat distribution. If your body stores fat primarily in your abdomen, your risk of type 2 diabetes is greater than if your body stores fat elsewhere, such as your hips and thighs. - Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk of type 2 diabetes. - Family history. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. - Race. Although it's unclear why, people of certain races - including blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans - are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than whites are.  - Age. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases as you get older, especially after age 45.",

Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis affect the respiratory system and digestive system. However, adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia.

Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren't able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often: - Foul-smelling, greasy stools - Poor weight gain and growth - Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus) - Severe constipation Frequent straining while passing stool can cause part of the rectum - the end of the large intestine - to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse).",

Stress and anxiety - perhaps triggered by problems with peers, teachers or parents - can play a role in children's headaches. Children with depression may complain of headaches, particularly if they have trouble recognizing feelings of sadness and loneliness. - Genetic predisposition.

It usually occurs with other symptoms, such as vision changes, sensitivity to sound or light, or nausea. - Migraines may be triggered by foods, such as chocolate, certain cheeses, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Caffeine withdrawal, lack of sleep, and alcohol may also be triggers. Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They often occur from overuse of pain medicines. Other types of headaches: - Cluster headache is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs daily, sometimes up to several times a day for months. It then goes away for weeks to months. In some people, the headaches never come back. - Sinus headache causes pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes.

            "The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by: - Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis - Birth defects of the heart - Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism) - Heart failure - Heart valve disease - HIV infection - Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic) - Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis - Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs) - Obstructive sleep apnea In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown.",
            "Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal.",
            "Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.",

            "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH (often called secondary PH), including: Mitral valve disease Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis",
            "The World Health Organization divides pulmonary hypertension (PH) into five groups. These groups are organized based on the cause of the condition. In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. The pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 8?20 mmHg at rest. Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Group 1 PAH includes: PAH that has no known cause. PAH that's inherited. PAH that's caused by drugs or toxins, such as street drugs and certain diet medicines. PAH that's caused by conditions such as: - Connective tissue diseases. - HIV infection. - Liver disease. - Congenital heart disease. Connective tissue diseases. Liver disease. Congenital heart disease. Group 2 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 2 includes PH with left heart disease. Conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease or long-term high blood pressure, can cause left heart disease and PH. Left heart disease is likely the most common cause of PH. Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 3 includes PH associated with lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial (IN-ter-STISH-al) lung diseases. Interstitial lung diseases cause scarring of the lung tissue. Group 3 also includes PH associated with sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea. Group 4 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 4 includes PH caused by blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders. Group 5 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 5 includes PH caused by various other diseases or conditions.",

Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpful. Your doctor might suggest a prescription pain reliever such as tramadol (Ultram). Narcotics are not advised, because they can lead to dependence and may even worsen the pain over time. - Antidepressants. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) may help ease the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline or the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine to help promote sleep. - Anti-seizure drugs.

Talking with a counselor can help strengthen your belief in your abilities and teach you strategies for dealing with stressful situations. Self-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia. - Reduce stress. Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress. Allow yourself time each day to relax. That may mean learning how to say no without guilt. But try not to change your routine completely. People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than do those who remain active. Try stress management techniques, such as deep-breathing exercises or meditation. - Get enough sleep. Because fatigue is one of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia, getting sufficient sleep is essential. In addition to allotting enough time for sleep, practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and limiting daytime napping. - Exercise regularly. At first, exercise may increase your pain. But doing it gradually and regularly often decreases symptoms. Appropriate exercises may include walking, swimming, biking and water aerobics. A physical therapist can help you develop a home exercise program. Stretching, good posture and relaxation exercises also are helpful. - Pace yourself. Keep your activity on an even level. If you do too much on your good days, you may have more bad days. Moderation means not overdoing it on your good days, but likewise it means not self-limiting or doing too little on the days when symptoms flare. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy foods. Limit your caffeine intake. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day. Complementary and alternative therapies for pain and stress management aren't new. Some, such as meditation and yoga, have been practiced for thousands of years. But their use has become more popular in recent years, especially with people who have chronic illnesses, such as fibromyalgia. Several of these treatments do appear to safely relieve stress and reduce pain, and some are gaining acceptance in mainstream medicine. But many practices remain unproved because they haven't been adequately studied. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical system based on restoring normal balance of life forces by inserting very fine needles through the skin to various depths. According to Western theories of acupuncture, the needles cause changes in blood flow and levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord. Some studies indicate that acupuncture helps relieve fibromyalgia symptoms, while others show no benefit. - Massage therapy. This is one of the oldest methods of health care still in practice. It involves use of different manipulative techniques to move your body's muscles and soft tissues. Massage can reduce your heart rate, relax your muscles, improve range of motion in your joints and increase production of your body's natural painkillers. It often helps relieve stress and anxiety. - Yoga and tai chi. These practices combine meditation, slow movements, deep breathing and relaxation. Both have been found to be helpful in controlling fibromyalgia symptoms.",

In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness.",
            "Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes people to have recurring seizures. The seizures happen when clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain send out the wrong signals. People may have strange sensations and emotions or behave strangely. They may have violent muscle spasms or lose consciousness.",
            "Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness.",
            "Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time. Seizures are episodes of uncontrolled and abnormal firing of brain cells that may cause changes in attention or behavior. Epilepsy occurs when permanent changes in the brain cause it to be too excitable or irritable. As a result, the brain sends out abnormal signals. This leads to repeated, unpredictable seizures.",
            "Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time. A seizure is a sudden change in the electrical and chemical activity in the brain. A single seizure that does not happen again is NOT epilepsy. The movements or symptoms of a seizure may depend on the part of the brain that is affected.  Epilepsy is often a lifelong or chronic illness. Important management issues include: - Taking medicines - Staying safe, such as never swimming alone, fall-proofing your home and so on  - Managing stress and sleep - Avoiding alcohol and drug abuse - Keeping up in school - Managing other illnesses ...  Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s. If your child does not have seizures for a few years, the provider may stop medicines. For many children, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, the medicines need to be continued. Children who have developmental disorders that also cause epilepsy may face challenges throughout their life. ...  There is no known way to prevent epilepsy. Proper diet and sleep may decrease the chances of seizures in children with epilepsy. Reduce the risk of head injury during risky activities. This can decrease the likelihood of a brain injury that leads to seizures and epilepsy.",
            "Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) refers to a group of inherited conditions involving the central nervous system and representing more than a dozen different diseases. These diseases share certain features, including a worsening of symptoms over time and the presence of both muscle contractions ( myoclonus) and seizures ( epilepsy). These rare disorders often get worse over time and sometimes are fatal. Many of these PME diseases begin in childhood or adolescence",
            "Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) is a genetic epilepsy with onset occurring around puberty. JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures ,  frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and sporadic myoclonic jerks. ... The seizures onset is typically between 9 and 13 years of age and it manifests as a ''staring spell'' that can be accompanied by atonic postures such as drooping of the head and/or automatisms such as lip smacking.",

Epilepsy onset is between infancy and adulthood; most cases occur in early childhood. Most patients present with occipital epileptic seizures, the course being highly variable, with benign, drug-resistant, or epileptic encephalopathy forms. In the latter, severe mental deterioration and/or learning disorders have been reported while a mild mental deterioration is observed in only one third of all CEC cases.",

Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you. - Practice safer sex. Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). - Limit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors. - Get Pap smears as often as your provider recommends. Pap smears can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer. - Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider. It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older. - If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your chance of getting cervical cancer.",

            "Most congenital heart defects result from problems early in your child's heart development, the cause of which is unknown. However, certain environmental and genetic risk factors may play a role. They include: - Rubella (German measles).  Having rubella during pregnancy can cause problems in your baby's heart development.  Diabetes. You can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects by carefully controlling your diabetes before attempting to conceive and during pregnancy.  Certain medications taken during pregnancy may cause birth defects, including congenital heart defects. Medications known to increase the risk of congenital heart defects include thalidomide (Thalomid), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins, the acne medication isotretinoin (Absorica, Amnesteem, Claravis) and lithium. - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Smoking during pregnancy increases the likelihood of a congenital heart defect in the baby. - Heredity. Congenital heart defects sometimes run in families and may be associated with a genetic syndrome. Many children with Down syndrome - which is caused by an extra 21st chromosome (trisomy 21) - have heart defects. A missing piece (deletion) of genetic material on chromosome 22 also causes heart defects.

The disorder is caused by a defective gene, RSK2, which is found in 1996 on the X chromosome (Xp22.2-p22.1). Thus, the syndrome is typically more severe in males because males have only one X chromosome, while females have two. It is unclear how changes (mutations) in the DNA structure of the gene lead to the clinical findings.",
            "Mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene cause Coffin-Lowry syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in signaling within cells. Researchers believe that this protein helps control the activity of other genes and plays an important role in the brain. The protein is involved in cell signaling pathways that are required for learning, the formation of long-term memories, and the survival of nerve cells. Gene mutations result in the production of little or no RPS6KA3 protein, but it is unclear how a lack of this protein causes the signs and symptoms of Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Some people with the features of Coffin-Lowry syndrome do not have identified mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. This condition is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes.

            "The type of treatment your doctor recommends will depend largely on the stage of your cancer. The three primary treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery for early-stage colon cancer If your colon cancer is very small, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive approach to surgery, such as: - Removing polyps during a colonoscopy. If your cancer is small, localized and completely contained within a polyp and in a very early stage, your doctor may be able to remove it completely during a colonoscopy. - Endoscopic mucosal resection. Removing larger polyps may require also taking a small amount of the lining of the colon or rectum in a procedure called an endoscopic mucosal resection. - Minimally invasive surgery. Polyps that can't be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon performs the operation through several small incisions in your abdominal wall, inserting instruments with attached cameras that display your colon on a video monitor. The surgeon may also take samples from lymph nodes in the area where the cancer is located. Surgery for invasive colon cancer If the cancer has grown into or through your colon, your surgeon may recommend: - Partial colectomy. During this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of your colon that contains the cancer, along with a margin of normal tissue on either side of the cancer. Your surgeon is often able to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum. This procedure can commonly be done by a minimally invasive approach (laparoscopy). - Surgery to create a way for waste to leave your body. When it's not possible to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum, you may need an ostomy. This involves creating an opening in the wall of your abdomen from a portion of the remaining bowel for the elimination of stool into a bag that fits securely over the opening. Sometimes the ostomy is only temporary, allowing your colon or rectum time to heal after surgery. In some cases, however, the colostomy may be permanent. - Lymph node removal. Nearby lymph nodes are usually also removed during colon cancer surgery and tested for cancer. Surgery for advanced cancer If your cancer is very advanced or your overall health very poor, your surgeon may recommend an operation to relieve a blockage of your colon or other conditions in order to improve your symptoms. This surgery isn't done to cure cancer, but instead to relieve signs and symptoms, such as bleeding and pain. In specific cases where the cancer has spread only to the liver but your overall health is otherwise good, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the cancerous lesion from your liver. Chemotherapy may be used before or after this type of surgery. This approach provides a chance to be free of cancer over the long term. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy for colon cancer is usually given after surgery if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes. In this way, chemotherapy may help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death from cancer.

Targeted drugs are typically reserved for people with advanced colon cancer. Some people are helped by targeted drugs, while others are not. Researchers have recently made progress in determining who is most likely to benefit from specific targeted drugs. Until more is known, doctors carefully weigh the possible benefit of targeted drugs against the risk of side effects and the cost when deciding whether to use these treatments. Immunotherapy Some patients with advanced colon cancer have a chance to benefit from immunotherapy with antibodies such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo).

Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families.

The sons of women who are carriers of the disease (women with a defective gene, but no symptoms themselves) each have a 50% chance of having the disease. The daughters each have a 50% chance of being carriers. Very rarely, a female can be affected by the disease. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs in about 1 out of every 3,600 male infants.

            "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive form of muscular dystrophy that occurs primarily in males, though in rare cases may affect females. ... Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable by 3 or 4 years of age and begins in the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and shoulders. ... DMD may also affect learning and memory, as well as communication and certain social emotional skills.  ...   Muscle weakness worsens with age and progresses to the arms, legs and trunk. Most children with DMD use a wheelchair full time by age 13. Heart and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teen years and lead to serious, life threatening complications. DMD is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the DMD gene . DMD is  inherited in an X-linked recessive  pattern; however, it may also occur in people who do not have a family history of DMD.  While there is no known cure for DMD, there are treatments that can help control symptoms. Due to the advancement of medical treatment, boys with DMD may now live into young adulthood. There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) but research is ongoing. The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of DMD and related complications caused by severe progressive muscle weakness and loss in order to maximize the quality of life. An enlarged, weakened heart (dilated cardiomyopathy ) may be treated with medications, but in severe cases a  heart transplant may be necessary. Assistive devices for breathing difficulties may be needed, especially at night and as the disease progresses. Steroids ( corticosteroids ) may improve the strength and function of muscles in people with DMD, including lung function.",

            "Esophageal cancer is cancer that starts in the esophagus. This is the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach. Esophageal cancer is not common in the United States. It occurs most often in men over 50 years old. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.  Squamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and drinking too much alcohol. Adenocarcinoma is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Having Barrett esophagus increases the risk of this type of cancer. Acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) can develop into Barrett esophagus. Other risk factors include smoking, being male, or being obese. Symptoms may include any of the following: - Backward movement of food through the esophagus and possibly mouth (regurgitation) - Chest pain not related to eating - Difficulty swallowing solids or liquids - Heartburn - Vomiting blood - Weight loss Tests used to help diagnose esophageal cancer may include: - Barium swallow - Chest MRI or thoracic CT (usually used to help determine the stage of the disease) - Endoscopic ultrasound (also sometimes used to determine the stage of disease) - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy - PET scan (sometimes useful for determining the stage of disease, and whether surgery is possible) Stool testing may show small amounts of blood in the stool. Upper endoscopy (EGD) will be used to obtain a tissue sample from the esophagus to diagnose cancer. When the cancer is only in the esophagus and has not spread, surgery will be done. The cancer and part, or all, of the esophagus is removed. Radiation therapy may also be used instead of surgery in some cases when the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus. Either chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform. If the person is too ill to have major surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms. This is called palliative therapy. In such cases, the disease is usually not curable. Beside a change in diet, other treatments that may be used to help the patient swallow include: - Dilating (widening) the esophagus using an endoscope. Sometimes a stent is placed to keep the esophagus open. - A feeding tube into the stomach. - Photodynamic therapy, in which a special drug is injected into the tumor and is then exposed to light. The light activates the medicine that attacks the tumor. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone When the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus, surgery may improve the chance of survival. When the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, a cure is generally not possible. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms. Complications may include: - Pneumonia - Severe weight loss from not eating enough",
            "Esophageal cancer is a cancer of the esophagus, the hollow tube that carries food and liquids from the throat to the stomach. As the cancer grows, symptoms may include painful or difficult swallowing, weight loss and coughing up blood. The exact cause is usually not known, but both environmental and genetic factors are throught to play a role in the development of this condition. In the United States, risk factors for developing esophageal cancer include smoking, heavy drinking, obesity, and damage from acid reflux. Treatments include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy , and laser therapy. Some patients may also need nutritional support, since the cancer or treatment may make it hard to swallow.",

            "Gastroparesis is a condition that affects the normal spontaneous movement of the muscles (motility) in your stomach. The cause of gastroparesis is usually unknown. Sometimes it's a complication of diabetes, and some people develop gastroparesis after surgery. Although there's no cure for gastroparesis, changes to your diet, along with medication, can offer some relief. Signs and symptoms of gastroparesis include: - Vomiting - Nausea - A feeling of fullness after eating just a few bites - Vomiting undigested food eaten a few hours earlier - Acid reflux - Abdominal bloating - Abdominal pain - Changes in blood sugar levels - Lack of appetite - Weight loss and malnutrition Many people with gastroparesis don't have any noticeable signs and symptoms. Doctors use several tests to help diagnose gastroparesis and rule out conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Tests may include: - Gastric emptying study. - Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Ultrasound. Upper gastrointestinal series. Treating gastroparesis begins with identifying and treating the underlying condition.  Many people can manage gastroparesis with diet changes and dietary changes are the first step in managing this condition. Some people with gastroparesis may be unable to tolerate any food or liquids. In these situations, doctors may recommend a feeding tube (jejunostomy tube) be placed in the small intestine. Or doctors may recommend a gastric venting tube to help relieve pressure from gastric contents. Feeding tubes can be passed through your nose or mouth or directly into your small intestine through your skin. The tube is usually temporary and is only used when gastroparesis is severe or when blood sugar levels can't be controlled by any other method. Some people may require an IV (parenteral) feeding tube that goes directly into a vein in the chest. A number of new therapies are being tried with the help of endoscopy - a slender tube that's threaded down the esophagus. One procedure used endoscopy to place a small tube (stent) where the stomach connects to the small intestine (duodenum) to keep this connection open. ... Doctors are also studying the use of a minimally invasive surgical technique when someone needs a feeding tube placed directly into the small intestine (jejunostomy tube). Gastric electrical stimulation and pacing Gastric electrical stimulation is a surgically implanted device that provides electrical stimulation to stimulate stomach muscles to move food more efficiently. Study results have been mixed. However, the device seems to be most helpful for people with diabetic gastroparesis.",
            "Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food? sometimes several hours after a meal. Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and gastric emptying tests. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. Treatment of gastroparesis may include medications, botulinum toxin, gastric electrical stimulation, jejunostomy, and parenteral nutrition. For people with gastroparesis and diabetes, a health care provider will likely adjust the person?s insulin regimen.",

            "Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a meal?instead of lying down?may assist with gastric emptying.A health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment.Metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Botulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Gastric Electrical StimulationThis treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. If medications and dietary changes don?t work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy.   When gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutrition?an IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis.",

            "Treatments for hair loss include medications, surgery, laser therapy, and wigs or hairpieces. Your doctor may suggest a combination of these approaches in order to get the best results.  ... If your hair loss is caused by an underlying disease, treatment for that disease will be necessary. ... Medications are available to treat pattern baldness. Two medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hair loss are: - Minoxidil (Rogaine). Minoxidil is an over-the-counter liquid or foam that you rub into your scalp twice a day to grow hair and to prevent further hair loss. It may be used by men and women. With this treatment, some people experience hair regrowth, a slower rate of hair loss or both. The effect peaks at 16 weeks and you need to keep applying the medication to retain benefits... Finasteride (Propecia). This prescription drug is available only to men. It's taken daily in pill form. Many men taking finasteride experience a slowing of hair loss, and some may show some new hair growth. You need to keep taking it to retain benefits. ...Hair transplant or restoration surgery can make the most of the hair you have left. During this procedure, your surgeon removes tiny plugs of skin, each containing a few hairs, from the back or sides of your scalp. He or she then implants the plugs into the bald sections of your scalp. You may be asked to take a hair loss medication before and after surgery to improve results. Surgical procedures to treat baldness are expensive and can be painful.... You may want to try a wig or a hairpiece as an alternative to medical treatment or if you don't respond to treatment. ... If your hair loss is due to a medical condition, the cost of a wig may be covered by insurance. You'll need a prescription for the wig from your doctor.",
            "The only medicine approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat female pattern baldness is minoxidil: - It is applied to the scalp. - For women, the 2% solution or 5% foam is recommended. - Minoxidil may help hair grow in about 1 in 4 or 5 of women. In most women, it may slow or stop hair loss. - You must continue to use this medicine for a long time. Hair loss starts again when you stop using it. Also, the hair that it helps grow will fall out. If minoxidil does not work, your provider may recommend other medicines, such as spironolactone, cimetidine, birth control pills, ketoconazole, among others. ... HAIR TRANSPLANT During hair transplant, tiny plugs of hair are removed from areas where hair is thicker, and placed (transplanted) in areas that are balding. ...OTHER SOLUTIONS Hair weaving, hairpieces, or a change in hairstyle can help hide hair loss and improve your appearance. This is often the least expensive and safest way to deal with female pattern baldness.",

            "Treatment depends on many things: - The cause of scoliosis - Where the curve is in your spine - How big the curve is - If your body is still growing Most people with idiopathic scoliosis do not need treatment. But you should still be checked by a doctor about every 6 months. If you are still growing, your doctor might recommend a back brace. A back brace prevents further curving.  Back braces work best in people over age 10.  You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly. Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible. Scoliosis treatment may also include: - Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace. - Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly.",
            "Most children with scoliosis have mild curves and probably won't need treatment with a brace or surgery. ... the decision to begin treatment is always made on an individual basis. Factors to be considered include: - Sex. Girls have a much higher risk of progression than do boys. - Severity of curve. Larger curves are more likely to worsen with time. - Curve pattern. Double curves, also known as S-shaped curves, tend to worsen more often than do C-shaped curves. - Location of curve. Curves located in the center (thoracic) section of the spine worsen more often than do curves in the upper or lower sections of the spine. - Maturity. If a child's bones have stopped growing, the risk of curve progression is low. That also means that braces have the most effect in children whose bones are still growing. Braces If your child's bones are still growing and he or she has moderate scoliosis, your doctor may recommend a brace. Wearing a brace won't cure scoliosis or reverse the curve, but it usually prevents further progression of the curve. Severe scoliosis typically progresses with time, so your doctor might suggest scoliosis surgery to reduce the severity of the spinal curve and to prevent it from getting worse. The most common type of scoliosis surgery is called spinal fusion. In spinal fusion, surgeons connect two or more of the bones in the spine (vertebrae) together, so they can't move independently.",
            "Treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may involve observation, bracing and/or surgery. Treatment recommendations are generally dependent upon the risk of curve progression.",
            "Your doctor may recommend the following treatments: - Observation. If the curve is mild and you are still growing, your doctor will re-examine you every few months. - Bracing. If the curve is moderate and you are still growing, your doctor may recommend a brace to keep the curve from getting worse. Braces are selected for the specific curve problem and fitted to each patient. Braces must be worn every day for the full number of hours prescribed by the doctor. - Surgery. If you are still growing and have a severe curve that is getting worse, your doctor may suggest surgery. This often involves fusing together two or more bones in the spine.  The doctor may also put in a metal rod or other device to help keep the spine straight after surgery. You should seek the advice of at least two experts, and ask about the benefits and risks of the surgery. The following treatments have not been shown to keep curves from getting worse in scoliosis: - Chiropractic treatment. - Electrical stimulation. - Nutritional supplements.",

If you are still growing, your doctor might recommend a back brace. A back brace prevents further curving. There are many different types of braces.

You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly. Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible: .... People with mild scoliosis do well with braces. They usually do not have long-term problems. Scoliosis treatment may also include: - Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace. - Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly.",
            "How well a person with scoliosis does depends on the type, cause, and severity of the curve. The more severe the curving, the more likely it will get worse after the child stops growing.

            "The goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. You may need to work with a team of health professionals - including a dietitian, behavior counselor or an obesity specialist - to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits. All weight-loss programs require changes in your eating habits and increased physical activity. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your level of obesity, your overall health and your willingness to participate in your weight-loss plan. Other treatment tools include: - Dietary changes - Exercise and activity - Behavior change - Prescription weight-loss medications - Weight-loss surgery",
            "Treatment for overweight and obesity depends on the cause and severity of your condition. Possible treatments include healthy lifestyle changes, behavioral weight-loss treatment programs, medicines, and possibly surgery. Learn about which foods and nutrients are part of a healthy eating pattern. It?s important to eat the right amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, try to reduce your total daily calories gradually. Many health benefits are associated with physical activity and getting the recommended amount of physical activity needed each week. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor about what level of physical activity is right for you. Studies have shown some relationship between lack of sleep and obesity. Your doctor may recommend you enroll in individual or group behavioral weight-loss programs to treat your overweight and obesity. In these programs, a trained healthcare professional will customize a weight-loss plan for you. This plan will include a moderately-reduced calorie diet, physical activity goals, and behavioral strategies to help you make and maintain these lifestyle changes. When healthy lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may treat your overweight and obesity with FDA-approved medicines. Several medicines change the way the brain regulates the urge to eat, which can help to decrease appetite. Some examples of these medicines are diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide. Gastrointestinal tract. Orlistat is the only available medicine. It blocks your intestines from absorbing fat from foods in your diet. Some patients with obesity do not respond to healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. When these patients develop certain obesity-related complications, they may be eligible for the following surgeries. Gastric bypass surgery. Gastrectomy. Gastric banding. Talk to your doctor to learn more about the benefits and risks of each type of surgery. After surgery, some people are less interested in eating or they prefer to eat healthier foods. In some cases, genetic differences may affect how much weight loss patients experience after bariatric surgery.",
            "An active lifestyle and plenty of exercise, along with healthy eating, is the safest way to lose weight. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle. Work with your provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Your dietitian can teach you about: - Healthy food choices - Healthy snacks - Reading nutrition labels - New ways to prepare food - Portion sizes - Sweetened drinks Extreme diets (fewer than 1100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects.  Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine. Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you. Weight-loss surgeries include: - Laparoscopic gastric banding - Gastric bypass surgery - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common) - Duodenal switch",
            "By choosing an off-label medication to treat overweight and obesity, your doctor may prescribea drug approved for treating a different medical problem two or more drugs at the same time a drug for a longer period of time than approved by the FDAYou should feel comfortable asking your doctor if he or she is prescribing a medication that is not approved just for treating overweight and obesity. Before using a medication, learn all you need to know about it.",
            "If you are struggling with your weight, you may find that a healthy eating plan and regular physical activity help you lose weight and keep it off over the long term. If these lifestyle changes are not enough to help you lose weight or maintain your weight loss, your doctor may prescribe medications as part of your weight-control program. Prescription medications to treat overweight and obesity work in different ways. For example, some medications may help you feel less hungry or full sooner. Other medications may make it harder for your body to absorb fat from the foods you eat. Weight-loss medications are meant to help people who may have health problems related to overweight or obesity. Weight-loss medications don?t replace physical activity and healthy eating habits. When combined with changes to behavior, including eating and physical activity habits, prescription medications may help some people lose weight.",
            "Children ages 6 to 11 who are obese might be encouraged to modify their eating habits for gradual weight loss of no more than 1 pound (or about 0.5 kilogram) a month. Older children and adolescents who are obese or severely obese might be encouraged to modify their eating habits to aim for weight loss of up to 2 pounds (or about 1 kilogram) a week. Your child needs to eat a healthy diet - both in terms of type and amount of food - and increase physical activity. When food shopping, choose fruits and vegetables. Cut back on convenience foods - such as cookies, crackers and prepared meals - which are often high in sugar, fat and calories. Always have healthy snacks available. - Limit sweetened beverages. This includes those that contain fruit juice. Limit fast food. Sit down together for family meals. Make it an event - a time to share news and tell stories. Discourage eating in front of a TV, computer or video game screen, which can lead to fast eating and lowered awareness of amount eaten. - Serve appropriate portion sizes. Allow your child to eat until he or she is full, even if that means leaving food on the plate. And remember, when you eat out, restaurant portion sizes are often significantly oversized.  A critical part of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, especially for children, is physical activity. It burns calories, strengthens bones and muscles, and helps children sleep well at night and stay alert during the day.  Emphasize activity, not exercise. Children should be moderately to vigorously active for at least an hour a day. Your child's activity doesn't have to be a structured exercise program - the object is to get him or her moving. Free-play activities - such as playing hide-and-seek, tag or jump-rope - can be great for burning calories and improving fitness.  Medication might be prescribed for some adolescents as part of an overall weight-loss plan. The risks of taking a prescription medication over the long term are unknown, and the medication's effect on weight loss and weight maintenance for adolescents is still in question.  Weight-loss surgery may be an option for severely obese adolescents who have been unable to lose weight through lifestyle changes. However, as with any type of surgery, there are potential risks and long-term complications. Also, the long-term effects of weight-loss surgery on future growth and development are largely unknown. Weight-loss surgery in adolescents is uncommon.  It's important that a child being considered for weight-loss surgery meet with a team of pediatric specialists, including a pediatric endocrinologist, psychologist and dietitian. Weight-loss surgery isn't a miracle cure. It doesn't guarantee that an adolescent will lose all of his or her excess weight or be able to keep it off long term. And surgery doesn't replace the need for a healthy diet and regular physical activity.",
            "Numerous dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The effectiveness, particularly the long-term effectiveness, and safety of these products are often questionable. Talk to your doctor before taking any dietary supplements. Mind-body therapies - such as acupuncture, mindfulness meditation and yoga - may complement other obesity treatments. However, these therapies generally haven't been well-studied in the treatment of weight loss. Talk to your doctor if you're interested in adding a mind-body therapy to your treatment.",

For some women, the pain symptoms associated with endometriosis get milder after menopause ...  In some cases, inflammation and chemicals produced by the endometriosis areas can cause the pelvic organs to adhere, or stick together, causing scar tissue. This makes the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, as well as the bladder and rectum, appear as one large organ. ...Over time, some endometriosis areas may form nodules or bumps as they create lesions on the surface of pelvic organs or can become cysts (fluid-filled sacs) on the ovaries. - Some endometriosis lesions have nerves in them, tying the patches directly into the central nervous system. ...

In some cases, women with endometriosis also have breast cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, these situations are rare.... For about one-quarter of women diagnosed with endometriosis, endometriosis patches go away on their own.  Also, after menopause, symptoms of endometriosis typically lessen because there is a drop in the woman's natural hormones and the growths gradually shrink.

            "If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail.  - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence.",

Sit in the bath 2 to 3 times a day. The water should cover only the hips and buttocks. If the anal fissures do not go away with home care methods, treatment may involve: - Botox injections into the muscle in the anus (anal sphincter) - Minor surgery to relax the anal muscle - Prescription creams such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers, applied over the fissure to help relax the muscles",

Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear.",

Don't try to treat an ingrown nail at home. Otherwise, to treat an ingrown nail at home: - Soak the foot in warm water 3 to 4 times a day if possible. After soaking, keep the toe dry. - Gently massage over the inflamed skin. - Place a small piece of cotton or dental floss under the nail. Wet the cotton or floss with water or antiseptic. When trimming your toenails: - Briefly soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails. - Use a clean, sharp trimmer. - Trim toenails straight across the top. Do not taper or round the corners or trim too short.  - Do not try to cut out the ingrown portion of the nail yourself. This will only make the problem worse. Consider wearing sandals until the problem goes away. Over-the-counter medicine that is applied to the ingrown toenail may help with the pain, but it does not treat the problem. If this doesn't work and the ingrown nail gets worse, see your family doctor, a foot specialist (podiatrist), or a skin specialist (dermatologist). If the ingrown nail doesn't heal or keeps coming back, your provider may remove part of the nail: - Numbing medicine is first injected into the toe. - The ingrown part of the nail is removed. This procedure is called a partial nail avulsion. - It takes 2 to 4 months for the nail to regrow. If the toe is infected, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. After the procedure, follow any instructions for helping your nail heal.",

            "X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that cause damage to the myelin sheath, an insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain. Women have two X chromosomes and are the carriers of the disease, but since men only have one X chromosome and lack the protective effect of the extra X chromosome, they are more severely affected. People with X-ALD accumulate high levels of saturated, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in the brain and adrenal cortex. The loss of myelin and the progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland are the primary characteristics of X-ALD. While nearly all patients with X-ALD suffer from adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, the neurological symptoms can begin either in childhood or in adulthood. The childhood cerebral form is the most severe, with onset between ages 4 and 10. The most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance.Other symptoms include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive dementia.  The milder adult-onset form is also known as adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), which typically begins between ages 21 and 35. Symptoms may include progressive stiffness, weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs, and ataxia. Although adult-onset ALD progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form, it can also result in deterioration of brain function. Almost half the women who are carriers of X-ALS will develop a milder form of AMN but almost never will develop symptoms seen in boys the X-ALD.",

            "Adrenoleukodystrophy describes several closely related disorders that disrupt the breakdown of certain fats. These disorders are passed down (inherited) in families. ... The condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body. There are 3 major categories of disease: - Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8) - Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life - Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype.) - adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones ... Adrenal dysfunction may be treated with steroids (such as cortisol) if the adrenal gland is not producing enough hormones. A specific treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is not available. A bone marrow transplant can cure a people of the condition. The childhood form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a progressive disease. It leads to a long-term coma (vegetative state) about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop. The child can live in this condition for as long as 10 years until death occurs. The other forms of this disease are milder.",
            "X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited  condition that occurs mostly in males.  The condition mainly affects the nervous system and the adrenal glands (small glands located on top of each kidney). People with this disorder often have progressive destruction of the fatty covering ( myelin ) that insulates nerves in the brain and spinal cord. ... X-ALD is caused by mutations in the  gene . These gene mutations cause a shortage (deficiency) of a protein  called adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP).  A deficiency of this protein leads to an abnormally high level of fat molecules called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) to build up in the body.  High levels of VLCFA may be toxic to the adrenal cortex and myelin.   There are several forms of X-ALD including: a childhood cerebral form, an adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) type, and an adrenal insufficiency-only type. Another form of ALD is occasionally seen in women who are carriers of the condition [1] A specific treatment for X-ALD is not currently available, but eating a diet low in VLCFA and taking special oils can lower the blood levels of VLCFA.  Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) may be an option for boys and adolescents in early stages who have evidence of brain involvement on MRI .

            "Kartagener syndrome is a type of p that is also characterized by situs inversus totalis (mirror-image reversal of internal organs ). The signs and symptoms vary but may include neonatal respiratory distress; frequent lung, sinus and middle ear infections beginning in early childhood; and infertility.   In people affected by situs inversus totalis, the internal organs including the heart, liver, spleen and intestine are on the opposite side of the body. Although the internal organs are abnormally placed, this condition typically does not cause any health problems. Kartagener syndrome can be caused by changes ( mutations ) in many different genes . These genes encode proteins that are important to the structure and function of cilia. Cilia are tiny, hair-like structures that are found on the surface of cells in various parts of the body such as the lining of the airway, the reproductive system, and other organs . Mutations in these genes cause the cilia to be either immotile (unable to move) or dysmotile (they move incorrectly), which leads to the many signs and symptoms of Kartagener syndrome. Scientists have identified several different genes that are associated with Kartagener syndrome; however, the genetic cause is unknown in some cases. Kartagener syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell . The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers . Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. Kartagener syndrome is typically suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. A diagnosis can be confirmed by examining a small sample of tissue ( biopsy ) from an area of the body known to have cilia such as the sinus cavities or the airway. Abnormalities in the structure of cilia, as seen in people affected by Kartagener syndrome, can be observed under a special microscope (called an electron microscope). If the disease-causing change ( mutation ) is known, genetic testing can also be used to confirm the diagnosis.l. There is currently no cure for Kartagener syndrome . Treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. Airway clearance therapy, similar to that used in cystic fibrosis, can loosen thick, sticky mucus so it can be cleared away. Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat respiratory, sinus, and middle ear infections and may be given on a long-term basis in people with chronic or frequent infections.  In people with severe lung disease, lung transplantation may be an option.  The long-term outlook for people with Kartagener syndrome varies widely and largely depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Chronic childhood infections can be very debilitating. However, with appropriate treatment, the progression of lung disease can be slowed and other complications such as hearing loss can be avoided.",

When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.",
            "Kartagener syndrome is characterized by p and situs inversus totalis. In people affected by situs inversus totalis, the internal organs including the heart, liver, spleen and intestine are on the opposite side of the body. Although the internal organs are abnormally placed, this condition typically does not cause any health problems. The signs and symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia vary, but may include: ... Frequent respiratory infections that can lead to severe lung damage Chronic nasal congestion Frequent sinus infections Recurrent middle ear infections, particularly in early childhood Hearing loss Hydrocephalus Infertility",

            "SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis is a kidney (renal) disorder that sometimes includes blood cell abnormalities. The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life. Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). There are two forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis; they are distinguished by their inheritance pattern. The autosomal dominant form is more common and is usually less severe than the autosomal recessive form. The autosomal dominant form can be associated with incomplete or complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is rarely associated with blood cell abnormalities. The autosomal recessive form is always associated with complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is more commonly associated with blood cell abnormalities, although not everyone with this form has abnormal blood cells.",
            "Both the autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis are caused by mutations in the SLC4A1 gene. ... the acid builds up in the blood in most affected individuals, leading to metabolic acidosis and the other features of complete distal renal tubular acidosis. It is not clear why some people develop metabolic acidosis and others do not. Researchers suggest that in individuals with incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis, another mechanism is able to help regulate blood acidity (pH) and keep metabolic acidosis from developing.  ... Some people have nonhereditary forms of distal renal tubular acidosis; these forms can be caused by immune system problems or other conditions that damage the kidneys. These individuals often have additional signs and symptoms related to the original condition.",
            "SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis can have different patterns of inheritance. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.",

            "Lewy body dementia is one of the most common forms of progressive dementia. People affected by this condition may experience a variety of symptoms such as changes in alertness and attention; hallucinations; problems with movement and posture; muscle stiffness; confusion; and/or memory loss. Although the exact cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood, symptoms are thought to result when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein (\"Lewy bodies\") accumulate in the brain. Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, more than one family member may be affected.  Studies of these families suggest that there may be a genetic component to the condition in some cases. Some of these cases appear to be due to single gene changes ( mutations ) that follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Other familial cases do not follow a specific pattern of inheritance and likely have a multifactorial cause (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors ). Most cases of Lewy body dementia are not thought to be inherited. There is currently no cure for Lewy body dementia; however, medications may be available to help manage the associated symptoms.",

            "Lewy body dementia signs and symptoms may include: - Visual hallucinations. Hallucinations may be one of the first symptoms, and they often recur.  Sound (auditory), smell (olfactory) or touch (tactile) hallucinations are possible. - Movement disorders. Signs of Parkinson's disease (parkinsonian symptoms), such as slowed movement, rigid muscles, tremor or a shuffling walk may occur. - Poor regulation of body functions (autonomic nervous system).

To reduce your child's symptoms, a number of prescription medications are available, including anti-seizure medications.  Children who have Tay-Sachs disease are at high risk of lung infections that cause breathing problems and frequently accumulate mucus in their lungs. Your child may need the mucus using chest physiotherapy (CPT) to help remove mucus from the lungs.   Your child may have trouble swallowing, or develop respiratory problems by inhaling food or liquid into the lungs while eating. To prevent those problems, your doctor may recommend an assistive feeding device ...  As the disease progresses, your child may benefit from physical therapy to help keep joints flexible and maintain as much ability to move (range of motion) as possible. Physical therapy can delay joint stiffness and reduce or delay the loss of function and pain that can result from shortened muscles. Gene therapy or enzyme replacement therapy research may eventually lead to a cure or treatment to slow the progression of Tay-Sachs disease.",

Then, symptoms begin and include progressive loss of mental ability, dementia, blindness, increased startle reflex to noise, progressive loss of hearing leading to deafness, and difficulty with swallowing.  Seizures may begin in the child's second year. Persons with Tay-Sachs also have \"cherry-red\" spots in their eyes.  Affected individuals and carriers of Tay-Sachs disease can be identified by a blood test that measures hexosaminidase A activity. Both parents must carry the mutated gene in order to have an affected child. Presently there is no specific treatment for Tay-Sachs disease. Anticonvulsant medicine may initially control seizures. Other supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and techniques to keep the airway open. Children may eventually need a feeding tube.

            "In Menkes syndrome, cells in the body can absorb copper, but they are unable to release it. Menkes syndrome is caused by a defect in the ATP7A gene. The defect makes it hard for the body to distribute copper in food from the intestines into the bloodstream for use in other areas. As a result, the brain and other parts of the body do not get enough copper. Copper can build up in the small intestine and kidneys, but low copper levels in other areas can affect the structure of bone, skin, hair, and blood vessels, and interfere with nerve function. Menkes syndrome is inherited, which means it runs in families. Symptoms of Menkes syndrome are: - Bone spurs - Brittle, kinky hair - Feeding difficulties - Irritability - Lack of muscle tone, floppiness - Low body temperature - Mental deterioration - Pudgy, rosy cheeks - Seizures - Skeletal changes There is often a history of Menkes syndrome in a male relative. Signs include: - Abnormal appearance of the hair under a microscope - Abnormally low body temperature - Bleeding in the brain - Slow growth in the womb In males, all of the hairs will be abnormal. In females who carry this trait, half of them may have areas of abnormal hair. Treatment usually only helps when started very early in the course of the disease. Injections of copper into a vein or under the skin have been used with mixed results. Most people with this condition die within the first few years of life.",
            "Menkes syndrome is a disorder that affects copper levels in the body. It is characterized by sparse, kinky hair; failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); and deterioration of the nervous system. Additional signs and symptoms include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), sagging facial features, seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Children with Menkes syndrome typically begin to develop symptoms during infancy and often do not live past age 3. Early treatment with copper may improve the prognosis in some affected individuals. In rare cases, symptoms begin later in childhood.",
            "In Menkes syndrome, cells in the body can absorb copper, but they are unable to release it.",
            "Researchers have identified more than 150 mutations in the ATP7A gene that cause Menkes syndrome. All of these mutations prevent the production of functional ATP7A protein. As a result, the absorption of copper from food is impaired, and copper is not supplied to certain enzymes. The disrupted activity of the ATP7A protein causes copper to be poorly distributed to cells in the body. Copper accumulates in some tissues, such as the small intestine and kidneys, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes, affecting the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. The signs and symptoms of Menkes syndrome are caused by the reduced activity of these copper-containing enzymes.",

Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. The disease is rare in people under age 40.  Cardiac amyloidosis may affect the way electrical signals move through the heart (conduction system). This can lead to abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) and faulty heart signals (heart block).

            "An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment. ...  Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one. .. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure.",
            "Anal fissure: An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter).  ... Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. ... - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear.",
            "Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include: ... Aging. Older adults may develop an anal fissure partly due to slowed circulation, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rectal area. - Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing. ... Crohn's disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing. - Anal intercourse.",
            "Common causes of anal fissure include: - Passing large or hard stools - Constipation and straining during bowel movements - Chronic diarrhea - Inflammation of the anorectal area, caused by Crohn's disease or another inflammatory bowel disease - Childbirth Less common causes of anal fissures include: - Anal cancer - HIV - Tuberculosis - Syphilis - Herpes",
            "Anal fissure (Diagnosis): If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition.",
            "Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. ... Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly.  Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. ...  Avoid straining during bowel movements.",
            "Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include: - Pain, sometimes severe, during bowel movements - Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours - Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement - Itching or irritation around the anus - A visible crack in the skin around the anus - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure",

            "There is currently no cure for Milroy disease. Management is typically conservative and usually successful in most people. Management of lymphedema should be guided by a lymphedema therapist. Some improvement is usually possible with the use of properly fitted compression hosiery or bandaging and well fitting, supportive shoes. Good skin care is essential. Decongestive physiotherapy , which combines compression bandaging, manual lymphatic drainage (a specialized massage technique), exercise, breathing exercises, dietary measures and skin care, has become the standard of care for primary lymphedema.  People with recurrent cellulitis may benefit from prophylactic antibiotics  Surgical intervention is considered a last option when other medical management fails.  When possible, people with Milroy disease should avoid: wounds to swollen areas (because of their reduced resistance to infection) long periods of immobility prolonged standing elevation of the affected limb certain medications (particularly calcium channel-blocking drugs that can cause increased leg swelling in some people",
            "Milroy disease is a condition that affects the normal function of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system produces and transports fluids and immune cells throughout the body. Impaired transport with accumulation of lymph fluid can cause swelling (lymphedema). Individuals with Milroy disease typically have lymphedema in their lower legs and feet at birth or develop it in infancy. The lymphedema typically occurs on both sides of the body and may worsen over time. Milroy disease is associated with other features in addition to lymphedema. Males and females may have upslanting toenails, deep creases in the toes, wart-like growths (papillomas), and prominent leg veins. Some individuals develop non-contagious skin infections called cellulitis that can damage the thin tubes that carry lymph fluid (lymphatic vessels). Episodes of cellulitis can cause further swelling in the lower limbs.",
            "The symptoms and severity of Milroy disease can vary among affected people (even within the same family), so the long-term effects of the condition may be difficult to predict. Swelling varies in degree and distribution, and can be disabling and disfiguring.  For some people the outlook depends on how chronic the lymphedema is, as well as whether complications arise.  However, Milroy disease is rarely associated with significant complications.  The degree of edema sometimes progresses, but in some cases can improve (particularly in early years).  Complications of lymphedema may include recurrent bouts of cellulitis and/or lymphangitis, bacterial and fungal infections, deep venous thrombosis, functional impairment, cosmetic embarrassment, and amputation. Complications following surgery are common.",

Treatments may include any of the following: - Keeping blood pressure at or below 130/80 mm Hg to delay kidney damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the medicines most often used. ACE inhibitors and ARBs may also help decrease the amount of protein lost in the urine. - Corticosteroids and other drugs that suppress or quiet the immune system. - Treating high cholesterol to reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel problems. A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet is usually not enough for people with nephrotic syndrome. Medicines to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides (usually statins) may be needed. - A low-salt diet may help with swelling in the hands and legs. Water pills (diuretics) may also help with this problem. - Low-protein diets may be helpful. Your health care provider may suggest a moderate-protein diet (1 gram [gm] of protein per kilogram [kg] of body weight per day). - Taking vitamin D supplements if nephrotic syndrome is long-term and is not responding to treatment. - Taking blood thinner drugs to treat or prevent blood clots.",

            "Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus).  The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time.",
            "X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (XLCSNB) is a disorder of the retina. People with this condition typically experience night blindness and other vision problems, including loss of sharpness ( reduced visual acuity), severe nearsightedness (myopia), nystagmus , and strabismus . Color vision is typically not affected. These vision problems are usually evident at birth, but tend to be stable (stationary) over time.",
            "Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments. Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown.",

            "Optic nerve atrophy is damage to the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries images of what the eye sees to the brain. There are many causes of optic atrophy. The most common is poor blood flow. This is called ischemic optic neuropathy. The problem most often affects older adults. The optic nerve can also be damaged by shock, toxins, radiation, and trauma. Eye diseases, such as glaucoma, can also cause a form of optic nerve atrophy. The condition can also be caused by diseases of the brain and central nervous system. These may include: - Brain tumor - Cranial arteritis (sometimes called temporal arteritis) - Multiple sclerosis - Stroke There are also rare forms of hereditary optic nerve atrophy that affect children and young adults.",
            "Optic atrophy 1 ...  is usually caused by  mutations in the OPA1 gene , although some individuals with optic atrophy 1 do not have identified mutations in this gene, in which case the cause of the condition is unknown. This condition is inherited in an  autosomal dominant pattern but some cases result from a new mutation in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.",
            "Optic atrophy type 1 is caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene. Mutations in the OPA1 gene lead to problems with mitochondrial function. The mitochondria become misshapen and disorganized and have reduced energy-producing capabilities. The maintenance of mtDNA may also be impaired, resulting in mtDNA mutations that further interfere with mitochondrial energy production. Cells that contain these poorly functioning mitochondria are more susceptible to apoptosis. In particular, cells that have high energy demands, such as retinal ganglion cells, die over time. Specialized extensions of retinal ganglion cells, called axons, form the optic nerves, so when retinal ganglion cells die, the optic nerves atrophy and cannot transmit visual information to the brain. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.",
            "Many causes of optic nerve atrophy cannot be prevented.  Prevention steps include: - Older adults should have their provider carefully manage their blood pressure. - Use standard safety precautions to prevent injuries to the face.  - Schedule a routine annual eye exam to check for glaucoma. - Methanol, which is found in home-brewed alcohol, can cause optic nerve atrophy in both eyes.",

Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis. -Family history. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease. - Smoking. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity. - Environmental exposures. Although uncertain and poorly understood, some exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis. - Obesity. People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger.",

Overweight or obese women are also more likely to have preeclampsia in more than one pregnancy.6 - Age. Women older than 40 are at higher risk. - Multiple gestation (being pregnant with more than one fetus) - African American ethnicity. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends that women who are at high risk for preeclampsia take low-dose aspirin starting after 12 weeks of pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia.17 Women who are pregnant or who are thinking about getting pregnant should talk with their health care provider about preeclampsia risk and ways to reduce the risk.",
            "The exact cause of preeclampsia involves several factors. Experts believe it begins in the placenta - the organ that nourishes the fetus throughout pregnancy. Early in pregnancy, new blood vessels develop and evolve to efficiently send blood to the placenta. In women with preeclampsia, these blood vessels don't seem to develop or function properly. They're narrower than normal blood vessels and react differently to hormonal signaling, which limits the amount of blood that can flow through them. Causes of this abnormal development may include: - Insufficient blood flow to the uterus - Damage to the blood vessels - A problem with the immune system - Certain genes",
            "Risk factors include: - History of preeclampsia. A personal or family history of preeclampsia significantly raises your risk of preeclampsia. - Chronic hypertension. If you already have chronic hypertension, you have a higher risk of developing preeclampsia. - First pregnancy. The risk of developing preeclampsia is highest during your first pregnancy. - New paternity. Each pregnancy with a new partner increases the risk of preeclampsia more than does a second or third pregnancy with the same partner. - Age. The risk of preeclampsia is higher for very young pregnant women as well as pregnant women older than 40. - Obesity. The risk of preeclampsia is higher if you're obese. - Multiple pregnancy. Preeclampsia is more common in women who are carrying twins, triplets or other multiples. - Interval between pregnancies. Having babies less than two years or more than 10 years apart leads to a higher risk of preeclampsia. - History of certain conditions. Having certain conditions before you become pregnant - such as chronic high blood pressure, migraines, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, a tendency to develop blood clots, or lupus - increases your risk of preeclampsia. - In vitro fertilization.

            "Possible treatment for preeclampsia may include: - Medications to lower blood pressure. These medications, called antihypertensives, are used to lower your blood pressure if it's dangerously high.  Although there are many different types of antihypertensive medications, a number of them aren't safe to use during pregnancy. Discuss with your doctor whether you need to use an antihypertensive medicine in your situation to control your blood pressure. - Corticosteroids. If you have severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome, corticosteroid medications can temporarily improve liver and platelet function to help prolong your pregnancy. Corticosteroids can also help your baby's lungs become more mature in as little as 48 hours - an important step in preparing a premature baby for life outside the womb. - Anticonvulsant medications. If your preeclampsia is severe, your doctor may prescribe an anticonvulsant medication, such as magnesium sulfate, to prevent a first seizure. Bed rest Bed rest used to be routinely recommended for women with preeclampsia. But research hasn't shown a benefit from this practice, and it can increase your risk of blood clots, as well as impact your economic and social lives. For most women, bed rest is no longer recommended. Hospitalization Severe preeclampsia may require that you be hospitalized. In the hospital, your doctor may perform regular nonstress tests or biophysical profiles to monitor your baby's well-being and measure the volume of amniotic fluid.  If you're diagnosed with preeclampsia near the end of your pregnancy, your doctor may recommend inducing labor right away.",

According to the World Health Organization, among women who have had preeclampsia, about 20% to 40% of their daughters and 11% to 37% of their sisters also will get the disorder.7Preeclampsia is also more common among women who have histories of certain health conditions, such as migraines,8 diabetes,9 rheumatoid arthritis,10 lupus,11 scleroderma,12 urinary tract infections,13 gum disease,14 polycystic ovary syndrome,15 multiple sclerosis, gestational diabetes, and sickle cell disease.16Preeclampsia is also more common in pregnancies resulting from egg donation, donor insemination, or in vitro fertilization. If you are at very high risk of preeclampsia, your doctor may recommend that you start taking low-dose aspirin after at least 12 weeks of pregnancy.2 [top] - Visit your health care provider for a preconception visit to discuss what you can do to lower your risk. Your health care provider may recommend ways to control your blood pressure, if needed, by limiting your salt intake, exercising regularly, and losing weight if you are overweight. - If you take medication to control your blood pressure, ask your health care provider if you should change it. Some medications should not be used during pregnancy. Your health care provider may be able to recommend safer alternatives. - Get regular prenatal care, including regular blood pressure checks, urine tests for protein, as well as regular weight checks. - Avoid alcohol and tobacco. - Talk with your health care provider about any drugs or supplements that you take or are thinking of taking, including vitamins and herbs.

            "Psoriasis treatments reduce inflammation and clear the skin. Treatments can be divided into three main types: topical treatments, light therapy and systemic medications. Used alone, creams and ointments that you apply to your skin can effectively treat mild to moderate psoriasis. When the disease is more severe, creams are likely to be combined with oral medications or light therapy. Topical psoriasis treatments include: - Topical corticosteroids.  It's usually best to use topical corticosteroids as a short-term treatment during flares. - Vitamin D analogues. Calcipotriene (Dovonex) is a prescription cream or solution containing a vitamin D analogue that treats mild to moderate psoriasis along with other treatments. - Anthralin. This medication helps slow skin cell growth. Anthralin (Dritho-Scalp) can also remove scales and make skin smoother. But anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains almost anything it touches. It's usually applied for a short time and then washed off. - Topical retinoids. These are vitamin A derivatives that may decrease inflammation. These medications may also increase sensitivity to sunlight, so while using the medication apply sunscreen before going outdoors. Calcineurin inhibitors - tacrolimus (Prograf) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) - reduce inflammation and plaque buildup.  - Salicylic acid. Available over-the-counter (nonprescription) and by prescription, salicylic acid promotes sloughing of dead skin cells and reduces scaling. Sometimes it's combined with other medications, such as topical corticosteroids or coal tar, to increase its effectiveness. Salicylic acid is available in medicated shampoos and scalp solutions to treat scalp psoriasis. - Coal tar. Derived from coal, coal tar reduces scaling, itching and inflammation. Coal tar can irritate the skin. It's also messy, stains clothing and bedding, and has a strong odor. Coal tar is available in over-the-counter shampoos, creams and oils.    Light therapy (phototherapy) This treatment uses natural or artificial ultraviolet light. The simplest and easiest form of phototherapy involves exposing your skin to controlled amounts of natural sunlight. Other forms of light therapy include the use of artificial ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light, either alone or in combination with medications.  - Goeckerman therapy. Some doctors combine UVB treatment and coal tar treatment, which is known as Goeckerman treatment. The two therapies together are more effective than either alone because coal tar makes skin more receptive to UVB light. - Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). This form of photochemotherapy involves taking a light-sensitizing medication (psoralen) before exposure to UVA light.   If you have severe psoriasis or it's resistant to other types of treatment, your doctor may prescribe oral or injected drugs. This is known as systemic treatment. Because of severe side effects, some of these medications are used for only brief periods and may be alternated with other forms of treatment. - Retinoids. Related to vitamin A, this group of drugs may help if you have severe psoriasis that doesn't respond to other therapies. Side effects may include lip inflammation and hair loss.  - Methotrexate. Taken orally, methotrexate (Rheumatrex) helps psoriasis by decreasing the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation. It may also slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis in some people.  - Cyclosporine. Cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral) suppresses the immune system and is similar to methotrexate in effectiveness, but can only be taken short-term. - Drugs that alter the immune system (biologics). Several of these drugs are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. They include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), ustekinumab (Stelara), golimumab (Simponi), apremilast (Otezla), secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz). Most of these drugs are given by injection (apremilast is oral) and are usually used for people who have failed to respond to traditional therapy or who have associated psoriatic arthritis. Biologics must be used with caution because they have strong effects on the immune system and may permit life-threatening infections. In particular, people taking these treatments must be screened for tuberculosis. - Other medications. Thioguanine (Tabloid) and hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) are medications that can be used when other drugs can't be given.  A number of alternative therapies claim to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, including special diets, creams, dietary supplements and herbs. None have definitively been proved effective. But some alternative therapies are deemed generally safe, and they may be helpful to some people in reducing signs and symptoms, such as itching and scaling.  - Aloe vera. Taken from the leaves of the aloe vera plant, aloe extract cream may reduce redness, scaling, itching and inflammation.  - Fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil supplements may reduce inflammation associated with psoriasis, although results from studies are mixed. Taking 3 grams or less of fish oil daily is generally recognized as safe, and you may find it beneficial. - Oregon grape. Also known as barberry, topical applications of Oregon grape may reduce inflammation and ease psoriasis symptoms.  These measures may benefit you: - Take daily baths. Bathing daily helps remove scales and calm inflamed skin. Add bath oil, colloidal oatmeal, Epsom salts or Dead Sea salts to the water and soak. Avoid hot water and harsh soaps, which can worsen symptoms; use lukewarm water and mild soaps that have added oils and fats. Soak about 10 minutes then gently pat dry skin. - Use moisturizer. After bathing, apply a heavy, ointment-based moisturizer while your skin is still moist. For very dry skin, oils may be preferable - they have more staying power than creams or lotions do and are more effective at preventing water from evaporating from your skin. During cold, dry weather, you may need to apply a moisturizer several times a day. - Expose your skin to small amounts of sunlight. A controlled amount of sunlight can improve psoriasis, but too much sun can trigger or worsen outbreaks and increase the risk of skin cancer.  - Avoid psoriasis triggers, if possible. Find out what triggers, if any, worsen your psoriasis and take steps to prevent or avoid them. Infections, injuries to your skin, stress, smoking and intense sun exposure can all worsen psoriasis. - Avoid drinking alcohol.  If you do drink, keep it moderate.",

If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system's faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids can also be used. Newer drugs called biologics are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include: - Adalimumab (Humira) - Etanercept (Enbrel) - Infliximab (Remicade) - Ustekinumab (Stelara) - Secukinumab (Cosentyx) - Apremilast (Otezla) - Ixekizumab (Taltz) ...

Many\u00a0individuals do well with no therapy at all, especially since many medications have serious side effects and some carry significant risks.\u00a0 However, three forms of beta interferon (Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif) have now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS.\u00a0 The FDA has also approved ocrelizumab (brand name Ocrevus) to treat adults with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe.\u00a0 The FDA also has approved a synthetic form of myelin basic protein, called copolymer I (Copaxone), for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. Copolymer I has few side effects, and studies indicate that the agent can reduce the relapse rate by almost one third. \u00a0Other FDA approved drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS in adults include teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate. \u00a0An immunosuppressant treatment,Novantrone\u00a0(mitoxantrone), is\u00a0approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced or chronic MS. \u00a0The FDA has also approved dalfampridine (Ampyra) to improve walking in individuals with MS. One monoclonal antibody, natalizumab (Tysabri), was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce the frequency of attacks in people with relapsing forms of MS and was approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004.\u00a0 In 2006, the FDA again approved sale of the drug for MS but under strict treatment guidelines involving infusion centers where patients can be monitored by specially trained physicians. \u00a0While steroids do not affect the course of MS over time, they can reduce the duration and severity of attacks in some patients.\u00a0 Spasticity, which can occur either as a sustained stiffness caused by increased muscle tone or as spasms that come and go, is usually treated with muscle relaxants and tranquilizers such as baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, clonazepam, and dantrolene. Physical therapy and exercise can help preserve remaining function, and patients may find that various aids -- such as foot braces, canes, and walkers -- can help them remain independent and mobile.\u00a0 Avoiding excessive activity and avoiding heat are probably the most important measures patients can take to counter physiological fatigue.\u00a0 If psychological symptoms of fatigue such as depression or apathy are evident, antidepressant medications may help.\u00a0 Other drugs that may reduce fatigue in some, but not all, patients include amantadine (Symmetrel), pemoline (Cylert), and the still-experimental drug aminopyridine. Although improvement of optic symptoms usually occurs even without treatment, a short course of treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) followed by treatment with oral steroids is sometimes used.  The vast majority of patients are mildly affected, but in the worst cases, MS can render a person unable to write, speak, or walk.\u00a0 MS is a disease with a natural tendency to remit spontaneously, for which there is no universally effective treatment.",

            "The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, usually given to children in the United States twice before they reach school age, is highly effective in preventing rubella.  Rubella is a mild infection. Once you've had the disease, you're usually permanently immune.  In rare cases, rubella can cause an ear infection (otitis media) or inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). No treatment will shorten the course of rubella infection, and symptoms are so mild that treatment usually isn't necessary. However, doctors often recommend isolation from others - especially pregnant women - during the infectious period.  In rare instances when a child or adult is infected with rubella, simple self-care measures are required: - Rest in bed as necessary. - Take acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to relieve discomfort from fever and aches. - Tell your child's school or child care provider that your child has rubella.",

            "Spina bifida treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Spina bifida occulta often doesn't require treatment at all, but other types of spina bifida do.  Surgery before birth Nerve function in babies with spina bifida can worsen after birth if it's not treated. Prenatal surgery for spina bifida (fetal surgery) takes place before the 26th week of pregnancy. Surgeons expose a pregnant mother's uterus surgically, open the uterus and repair the baby's spinal cord. Research suggests that children with spina bifida who had fetal surgery may have reduced disability and be less likely to need crutches or other walking devices. In addition, fetal surgery may reduce the risk of hydrocephalus. Ask your doctor whether this procedure may be appropriate for you.  Surgery after birth  Performing the surgery early can help minimize risk of infection that's associated with the exposed nerves and may also help protect the spinal cord from more trauma. During the procedure, a neurosurgeon places the spinal cord and exposed tissue inside the baby's body and covers them with muscle and skin. Sometimes a shunt to control hydrocephalus in the baby's brain is placed during the operation on the spinal cord.   Depending on the severity of spina bifida and the complications, treatment may include, for example: - Walking and mobility aids. Some babies may start exercises to prepare their legs for walking with braces or crutches when they're older. Some children may need walkers or a wheelchair. Mobility aids, along with regular physical therapy, can help a child become independent. - Bowel and bladder management.. - Bowel management may include oral medications, suppositories, enemas, surgery, or a combination of these approaches. - Bladder management may include medications, using catheters to empty the bladder, surgery, or a combination. -  - Treatment and management of other complications.

            "Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects. Sometimes it's caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury. The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes. How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms you have also help pinpoint the cause. Inner ear problems that cause dizziness (vertigo) Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system. These include your: - Eyes, which help you determine where your body is in space and how it's moving - Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions - Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion.",

There are two ways to approach the treatment of migraine headache with drugs: prevent the attacks, or relieve the symptoms during the attacks. Drugs originally developed for epilepsy, depression, or high blood pressure have been shown to be extremely effective in treating migraine. Botulinum toxin A has been shown to be effective in prevention of chronic migraine.  Behaviorally, stress management strategies may reduce the number and severity of migraine attacks. Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle. A weight loss program is recommended for obese individuals with migraine. Relief of symptoms, or acute treatments, during attacks consists of sumatriptan, ergotamine drugs, and analgesics such as ibuprofen and aspirin.

Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild.

Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of several genes. Parents may not have any family history of the condition. However, people with Williams syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. It often occurs randomly. Williams syndrome occurs in about 1 in 8,000 births. Symptoms of Williams syndrome are: - Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing - Developmental delay - Easily distracted, attention deficit disorder (ADD) - Feeding problems including colic, reflux, and vomiting - Inward bend of the small finger - Learning disorders - Mild to moderate intellectual disability - Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music - Short, compared to the rest of the person's family - Sunken chest The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show: - A flattened nasal bridge with small upturned nose - Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip - Prominent lips with an open mouth - Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye - Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth Signs include: - Narrowing of some blood vessels - Farsightedness - High blood calcium level that may cause seizures and rigid muscles - High blood pressure - Slack joints that may change to stiffness as the person gets older - Unusual star-like pattern in iris of the eye. There is no cure for Williams syndrome. Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium, if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. It is treated based on how severe it is. Physical therapy is helpful to people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other weaknesses. Other treatments are based on the person's symptoms.

Doctors tend to avoid prescribing antipsychotics for hallucinatory symptoms of DLB because of the risk that neuroleptic sensitivity could worsen the motor symptoms. Some individuals with DLB may benefit from the use of levodopa for their rigidity and loss of spontaneous movement.",

Your doctor may prescribe medications to treat other symptoms associated with Lewy body dementia, such as sleep or movement problems. Very rarely, certain second-generation antipsychotics may be prescribed for a short time at a low dose but only if the benefits outweigh the risks.

Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe shortage (deficiency) of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, E, and K). The signs and symptoms of this condition primarily affect the gastrointestinal system, eyes, nervous system, and blood. The first signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia appear in infancy. They often include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); diarrhea; and fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea). As an individual with this condition ages, additional signs and symptoms include disturbances in nerve function that may lead to poor muscle coordination and difficulty with balance and movement (ataxia). They can also experience a loss of certain reflexes, impaired speech (dysarthria), tremors or other involuntary movements (motor tics), a loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy), or muscle weakness. The muscle problems can disrupt skeletal development, leading to an abnormally curved lower back (lordosis), a rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis), high-arched feet (pes cavus), or an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot). Individuals with this condition may also develop an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, in which breakdown of the light-sensitive layer (retina) at the back of the eye can cause vision loss. In individuals with abetalipoproteinemia, the retinitis pigmentosa can result in complete vision loss. People with abetalipoproteinemia may also have other eye problems, including involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus), and weakness of the external muscles of the eye (ophthalmoplegia). Individuals with abetalipoproteinemia usually have a low number of red blood cells (anemia) with abnormally star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis) and have difficulty forming blood clots, which can cause abnormal bleeding. In some cases, a condition called fatty liver develops, which can cause liver damage. Frequency Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare disorder. More than 100 cases have been described worldwide. Causes Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by mutations in the MTTP gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. This protein is essential for creating molecules called beta-lipoproteins in the liver and intestine. Beta-lipoproteins transport fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the intestine to the bloodstream so these nutrients can be taken up by tissues throughout the body. Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal growth, development, and maintenance of the body's cells and tissues. Most MTTP gene mutations lead to the production of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein with reduced or absent function and unable to help in the formation of beta-lipoproteins. A lack of beta-lipoproteins causes severely reduced absorption (malabsorption) of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. These nutritional deficiencies lead to health problems in people with abetalipoproteinemia. Inheritance Pattern This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

                "document": " Cystic fibrosis Overview Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in people with cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas. Although cystic fibrosis requires daily care, people with the condition are usually able to attend school and work, and often have a better quality of life than people with cystic fibrosis had in previous decades. Improvements in screening and treatments mean people with cystic fibrosis now may live into their mid- to late 30s, on average, and some are living into their 40s and 50s. Cystic fibrosis care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms Screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis is now performed in every state in the United States. As a result, the condition can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. For people born before newborn screening was performed, it's important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis affect the respiratory system and digestive system. However, adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia. The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as: - A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum) - Wheezing - Breathlessness - Exercise intolerance - Repeated lung infections - Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren't able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often: - Foul-smelling, greasy stools - Poor weight gain and growth - Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus) - Severe constipation Frequent straining while passing stool can cause part of the rectum - the end of the large intestine - to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse). When this occurs in children, it may be a sign of cystic fibrosis. Parents should consult a physician knowledgeable about cystic fibrosis. Rectal prolapse in children may sometimes require surgery. Rectal prolapse in children with cystic fibrosis is less common than it was in the past, which may be due to earlier testing, diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis. If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis - or if someone in your family has cystic fibrosis - talk with your doctor about testing for the disease. Seek immediate medical care if you or your child has difficulty breathing. Causes In cystic fibrosis, a defect (mutation) in a gene changes a protein that regulates the movement of salt in and out of cells. The result is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as increased salt in sweat. Many different defects can occur in the gene. The type of gene mutation is associated with the severity of the condition. Children need to inherit one copy of the gene from each parent in order to have the disease. If children inherit only one copy, they won't develop cystic fibrosis. However, they will be carriers and possibly pass the gene to their own children. Risk factors - Family history. Because cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder, it runs in families. - Race. Although cystic fibrosis occurs in all races, it is most common in white people of Northern European ancestry. Complications - Damaged airways (bronchiectasis). Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of bronchiectasis, a condition that damages the airways. This makes it harder to move air in and out of the lungs and clear mucus from the airways (bronchial tubes). - Chronic infections. Thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses provides an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. People with cystic fibrosis may often have sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia. - Growths in the nose (nasal polyps). Because the lining inside the nose is inflamed and swollen, it can develop soft, fleshy growths (polyps). - Coughing up blood (hemoptysis). Over time, cystic fibrosis can cause thinning of the airway walls. As a result, teenagers and adults with cystic fibrosis may cough up blood. - Pneumothorax. This condition, in which air collects in the space that separates the lungs from the chest wall, also is more common in older people with cystic fibrosis. Pneumothorax can cause chest pain and breathlessness. - Respiratory failure. Over time, cystic fibrosis can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works. Lung function usually worsens gradually, and it eventually can become life-threatening. - Acute exacerbations. People with cystic fibrosis may experience worsening of their respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath, for several days to weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation and requires treatment in the hospital. - Nutritional deficiencies. Thick mucus can block the tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your intestines. Without these enzymes, your body can't absorb protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins. - Diabetes. The pancreas produces insulin, which your body needs to use sugar. Cystic fibrosis increases the risk of diabetes. Around 30 percent of people with cystic fibrosis develop diabetes by age 30. - Blocked bile duct. The tube that carries bile from your liver and gallbladder to your small intestine may become blocked and inflamed, leading to liver problems and sometimes gallstones. - Intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction can happen to people with cystic fibrosis at all ages. Children and adults with cystic fibrosis are more likely than are infants to develop intussusception, a condition in which a section of the intestines folds in on itself like an accordion. - Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). DIOS is partial or complete obstruction where the small intestine meets the large intestine. Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are infertile because the tube that connects the testes and prostate gland (vas deferens) is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely. Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with cystic fibrosis to become biological fathers. Although women with cystic fibrosis may be less fertile than other women, it's possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies. Still, pregnancy can worsen the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis, so be sure to discuss the possible risks with your doctor. - Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). People with cystic fibrosis are at higher risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones. - Electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. Because people with cystic fibrosis have saltier sweat, the balance of minerals in their blood may be upset. Signs and symptoms include increased heart rate, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure. Diagnosis To diagnose cystic fibrosis, doctors may conduct several tests. Newborn screening and diagnosis Every state in the U.S. now routinely screens newborns for cystic fibrosis. Early diagnosis means treatment can begin immediately. In one screening test, a blood sample is checked for higher than normal levels of a chemical (immunoreactive trypsinogen, or IRT) released by the pancreas. A newborn's IRT levels may be high because of premature birth or a stressful delivery. For that reason other tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Genetic tests may be used in addition to checking the IRT levels to confirm the diagnosis. Doctors may also conduct genetic tests to test for specific defects on the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. To evaluate if an infant has cystic fibrosis, doctors may also conduct a sweat test when the infant is at least 2 weeks old. In a sweat test, doctors apply a sweat-producing chemical to a small area of skin. They then collect the sweat to test it and see if it's saltier than normal. Testing may be done at a center specializing in cystic fibrosis. Testing of older children and adults Cystic fibrosis tests may be recommended for older children and adults who weren't screened at birth. Your doctor may suggest genetic and sweat tests for cystic fibrosis if you have recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), nasal polyps, chronic sinus or lung infections, bronchiectasis, or male infertility. Treatment There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but treatment can ease symptoms and reduce complications. Close monitoring and early, aggressive intervention is recommended. Managing cystic fibrosis is complex, so consider obtaining treatment at a center staffed by doctors and other staff trained in cystic fibrosis. Doctors may work with a multidisciplinary team of doctors and medical professionals trained in cystic fibrosis to evaluate and treat your condition. The goals of treatment include: - Preventing and controlling infections that occur in the lungs - Removing and loosening mucus from the lungs - Treating and preventing intestinal blockage - Providing adequate nutrition Medications The options may include: - Antibiotics to treat and prevent lung infections - Anti-inflammatory medications to lessen swelling in the airways in your lungs - Mucus-thinning drugs to help you cough up the mucus, which can improve lung function - Inhaled medications called bronchodilators that can help keep your airways open by relaxing the muscles around your bronchial tubes - Oral pancreatic enzymes to help your digestive tract absorb nutrients For those with cystic fibrosis who have certain gene mutations, doctors may recommend a newer medication called ivacaftor (Kalydeco). This medication may improve lung function and weight, and reduce the amount of salt in sweat. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people with cystic fibrosis who are age 6 and older. The dose depends on your weight and age. Doctors may conduct liver function tests and eye examinations before prescribing ivacaftor and on a regular basis while you're taking it to check for side effects such as liver function abnormalities and cataracts. For people with a certain gene mutation who are age 12 and older, another drug (Orkambi) is available that combines ivacaftor with a medication called lumacaftor. The combination of these medications may improve lung function and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, some people may experience side effects such as chest discomfort and shortness of breath soon after starting the medication. Some people may also have high blood pressure while taking the medication. Doctors may monitor you for any side effects. Chest physical therapy Loosening the thick mucus in the lungs makes it easier to cough up. Chest physical therapy helps loosen mucus. It is usually done from one to four times a day. A common technique is clapping with cupped hands on the front and back of the chest. Certain breathing techniques also may be used to help loosen the mucus. Your doctor will instruct you about the type of chest physical therapy he or she recommends for you. Mechanical devices also can help loosen lung mucus. These include a vibrating vest or a tube or mask you breathe into. Pulmonary rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend a long-term program that may improve your lung function and overall well-being. Pulmonary rehabilitation is usually done on an outpatient basis and may include: - Physical exercise that may improve your condition - Breathing techniques that may help loosen mucus and improve breathing - Nutritional counseling - Counseling and support - Education about your condition Surgical and other procedures - Nasal polyp removal. Your doctor may recommend surgery to remove nasal polyps that obstruct breathing. - Oxygen therapy. If your blood oxygen level declines, your doctor may recommend that you breathe pure oxygen to prevent high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). - Endoscopy and lavage. Mucus may be suctioned from obstructed airways through an endoscope. - Feeding tube. Cystic fibrosis interferes with digestion, so you can't absorb nutrients from food very well. Your doctor may suggest temporarily using a feeding tube to deliver extra nutrition while you sleep. This tube may be inserted in your nose and guided to your stomach, or it may be surgically implanted into the abdomen. - Bowel surgery. If a blockage develops in your bowel, you may need surgery to remove it. Intussusception, where a section of bowel has folded in on itself, also may require surgical repair. - Lung transplant. If you have severe breathing problems, life-threatening lung complications or increasing resistance to antibiotics used to treat lung infections, lung transplantation may be an option. Because bacteria line the airways in diseases that cause permanent widening of the large airways (bronchiectasis), such as cystic fibrosis, both lungs need to be replaced. Cystic fibrosis does not recur in transplanted lungs. However, other complications associated with cystic fibrosis - such as sinus infections, diabetes, pancreas problems and osteoporosis - can still occur after a lung transplant. Lifestyle and home remedies You can manage your condition and minimize complications in several ways. Always talk to your doctor before starting home remedies. Cystic fibrosis can cause malnourishment because the enzymes needed for digestion can't reach your small intestine, preventing food from being absorbed. People with cystic fibrosis may need a significantly higher number of calories daily than do people without the condition. A healthy diet is important to maintain good lung function. It's also important to drink lots of fluids, which can help thin the mucus in your lungs. You may work with a dietitian to develop a nutrition plan. Most people with cystic fibrosis need to take pancreatic enzyme capsules with every meal and snack. In addition, your doctor may recommend: - Antacids - Supplemental high-calorie nutrition - Special fat-soluble vitamins - Extra fiber to prevent intestinal blockage - Extra salt, especially during hot weather or before exercising - Adequate water during hot weather In addition to other usual childhood vaccines, people with cystic fibrosis should have the annual flu vaccine and any other vaccines their doctor recommends. Cystic fibrosis doesn't affect the immune system, but children with cystic fibrosis are more likely to develop complications when they become sick. Regular exercise helps loosen mucus in your airways, and strengthens your heart. For many people with cystic fibrosis, participating in sports can improve confidence and self-esteem. Anything that gets you moving, including walking and biking, can help. Don't smoke in your home or car, and don't allow other people to smoke around you or your child. Secondhand smoke is harmful for everyone, but especially for people with cystic fibrosis. Teach all the members of your family to wash their hands thoroughly before eating, after using the bathroom, when coming home from work or school, and after being around a person who is sick. Hand-washing is the best way to protect against infection. You'll have ongoing care from your doctor and other medical professionals. Make sure to attend your regular follow-up appointments. Take your medications as prescribed and follow therapies as instructed. Contact your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms such as severe constipation, more mucus than usual, blood in your mucus or reduced energy. ",

                "document": " Rasagiline Why is this medication prescribed? Rasagiline is used alone or in combination with another medication to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (a slowly progressing disease of the nervous system causing a fixed face without expression, tremor at rest, slowing of movements, walking with shuffling steps, stooped posture and muscle weakness). Rasagiline is in a class of medications called monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitors. It works by increasing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain. How should this medicine be used? Rasagiline comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take rasagiline at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rasagiline exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of rasagiline and may increase your dose based upon your body's response to this medication. Do not stop taking rasagiline without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking rasagiline, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as a fever; muscle stiffness; unsteadiness, wobbliness, or lack of coordination; or changes in consciousness. Tell your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms when your dose of rasagiline is decreased.

                "document": " Anxiety Overview Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings. Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood. Examples of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. You can have more than one anxiety disorder. Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment. Whatever form of anxiety you have, treatment can help. Anxiety care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: - Feeling nervous, restless or tense - Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom - Having an increased heart rate - Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) - Sweating - Trembling - Feeling weak or tired - Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry - Having trouble sleeping - Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems - Having difficulty controlling worry - Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Several types of anxiety disorders exist: - Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed. - Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. - Generalized anxiety disorder includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events - even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. - Panic disorder involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. - Selective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. - Separation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. - Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. - Specific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. - Substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of abusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. - Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive. When to see a doctor See your doctor if: - You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life - Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control - You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety - You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem - You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors - if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It's easier to treat if you get help early. Causes The causes of anxiety disorders aren't fully understood. Life experiences such as traumatic events appear to trigger anxiety disorders in people who are already prone to anxiety. Inherited traits also can be a factor. Medical causes For some people, anxiety may be linked to an underlying health issue. In some cases, anxiety signs and symptoms are the first indicators of a medical illness. If your doctor suspects your anxiety may have a medical cause, he or she may order tests to look for signs of a problem. Examples of medical problems that can be linked to anxiety include: - Heart disease - Diabetes - Thyroid problems, such as hyperthyroidism - Respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma - Drug abuse or withdrawal - Withdrawal from alcohol, anti-anxiety medications (benzodiazepines) or other medications - Chronic pain or irritable bowel syndrome - Rare tumors that produce certain \"fight-or-flight\" hormones Sometimes anxiety can be a side effect of certain medications. It's possible that your anxiety may be due to an underlying medical condition if: - You don't have any blood relatives (such as a parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder - You didn't have an anxiety disorder as a child - You don't avoid certain things or situations because of anxiety - You have a sudden occurrence of anxiety that seems unrelated to life events and you didn't have a previous history of anxiety Risk factors These factors may increase your risk of developing an anxiety disorder: - Trauma. Children who endured abuse or trauma or witnessed traumatic events are at higher risk of developing an anxiety disorder at some point in life. Adults who experience a traumatic event also can develop anxiety disorders. - Stress due to an illness. Having a health condition or serious illness can cause significant worry about issues such as your treatment and your future. - Stress buildup. A big event or a buildup of smaller stressful life situations may trigger excessive anxiety - for example, a death in the family, work stress or ongoing worry about finances. - Personality. People with certain personality types are more prone to anxiety disorders than others are. - Other mental health disorders. People with other mental health disorders, such as depression, often also have an anxiety disorder. - Having blood relatives with an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders can run in families. - Drugs or alcohol. Drug or alcohol use or abuse or withdrawal can cause or worsen anxiety. Complications Having an anxiety disorder does more than make you worry. It can also lead to, or worsen, other mental and physical conditions, such as: - Depression (which often occurs with an anxiety disorder) or other mental health disorders - Substance abuse - Trouble sleeping (insomnia) - Digestive or bowel problems - Headaches and chronic pain - Social isolation - Problems functioning at school or work - Poor quality of life - Suicide Diagnosis You may start by seeing your primary care doctor to find out if your anxiety could be related to your physical health. Your doctor can check for signs of an underlying medical condition that may need treatment. However, you may need to see a mental health specialist if you have severe anxiety. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. A psychologist and certain other mental health professionals can diagnose anxiety and provide counseling (psychotherapy). To help diagnose an anxiety disorder and rule out other conditions, your provider may: - Give you a psychological evaluation. This involves describing your thoughts, feelings and behavior to help pinpoint a diagnosis and check for related complications. Anxiety disorders often occur along with other mental health problems - such as depression or substance abuse - which can make diagnosis more challenging. - Compare your symptoms to the criteria in the DSM-5. Many doctors use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose an anxiety disorder. Treatment The two main treatments for anxiety disorders are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. It can be an effective treatment for anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. Generally a short-term treatment, CBT focuses on teaching you specific skills to improve your symptoms and gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. CBT includes exposure therapy, in which you gradually encounter the object or situation that triggers your anxiety so you build confidence that you can manage the situation and anxiety symptoms. Medications Several types of medications are used to help relieve symptoms, depending on the type of anxiety disorder you have and whether you also have other mental or physical health issues. For example: - Certain antidepressants are also used to treat anxiety disorders. - An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be prescribed. - In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a certain type of sedative called a benzodiazepine for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects of medications. Lifestyle and home remedies While most people with anxiety disorders need psychotherapy or medications to get anxiety under control, lifestyle changes also can make a difference. Here's what you can do: - Keep physically active. Develop a routine so that you're physically active most days of the week. Exercise is a powerful stress reducer. It may improve your mood and help you stay healthy. Start out slowly and gradually increase the amount and intensity of your activities. - Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs. These substances can cause or worsen anxiety. If you can't quit on your own, see your doctor or find a support group to help you. - Quit smoking and cut back or quit drinking caffeinated beverages. Both nicotine and caffeine can worsen anxiety. - Use stress management and relaxation techniques. Visualization techniques, meditation and yoga are examples of relaxation techniques that can ease anxiety. - Make sleep a priority. Do what you can to make sure you're getting enough sleep to feel rested. If you aren't sleeping well, see your doctor. - Eat healthy. Healthy eating - such as focusing on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and fish - may be linked to reduced anxiety, but more research is needed. Alternative medicine Several herbal remedies have been studied as a treatment for anxiety, but more research is needed to understand the risks and benefits. Herbal and dietary supplements aren't monitored by the FDA the same way medications are. You can't always be certain of what you're getting and whether it's safe. Some of these supplements can interfere with prescription medications or cause dangerous interactions. Before taking herbal remedies or dietary supplements, talk to your doctor to make sure they're safe for you and won't interact with any medications you take. ",

                "document": " Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary arterial hypertension Sporadic primary pulmonary hypertension Familial primary pulmonary hypertension Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension Primary pulmonary hypertension PPH Secondary pulmonary hypertension Cor pulmonale - pulmonary hypertension Summary Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal. Causes The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale. Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by: Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis Birth defects of the heart Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism) Heart failure Heart valve disease HIV infection Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic) Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis or any other severe chronic lung condition Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs) Obstructive sleep apnea In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known. IPAH affects more women than men. If pulmonary hypertension is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension. Symptoms Shortness of breath or lightheadedness during activity is often the first symptom. Fast heart rate (palpitations) may be present. Over time, symptoms occur with lighter activity or even while at rest. Other symptoms include: Ankle and leg swelling Bluish color of the lips or skin (cyanosis) Chest pain or pressure, usually in the front of the chest Dizziness or fainting spells Fatigue Increased abdomen size Weakness People with pulmonary hypertension often have symptoms that come and go. They report good days and bad days. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. The exam may find: Abnormal heart sounds Feeling of a pulse over the breastbone Heart murmur on the right side of the heart Larger-than-normal veins in the neck Leg swelling Liver and spleen swelling Normal breath sounds if pulmonary hypertension is idiopathic or due to congenital heart disease Abnormal breath sounds if pulmonary hypertension is from other lung disease In the early stages of the disease, the exam may be normal or almost normal. The condition may take several months to diagnose. Asthma and other diseases may cause similar symptoms and must be ruled out. Tests that may be ordered include: Blood tests Cardiac catheterization Chest x-ray CT scan of the chest Echocardiogram ECG Lung function tests Nuclear lung scan Pulmonary arteriogram 6-minute walk test Sleep study Tests to check for autoimmune problems Treatment There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms and prevent more lung damage. It is important to treat medical disorders that cause pulmonary hypertension, such as obstructive sleep apnea, lung conditions, and heart valve problems. Many treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension are available. If you are prescribed medicines, they may be taken by mouth (oral), received through the vein (intravenous, or IV), or breathed in (inhaled). Your provider will decide which medicine is best for you. You will be closely monitored during treatment to watch for side effects and to see how well you are responding to the medicine. DO NOT stop taking your medicines without talking to your provider. Other treatments may include: Blood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots, especially if you have IPAH Oxygen therapy at home Lung, or in some cases, heart-lung transplant, if medicines do not work Other important tips to follow: Avoid pregnancy Avoid heavy physical activities and lifting Avoid traveling to high altitudes Get a yearly flu vaccine, as well as other vaccines such as the pneumonia vaccine Stop smoking Outlook (Prognosis) How well you do depends on what caused the condition. Medicines for IPAH may help slow the disease. As the illness gets worse, you will need to make changes in your home to help you get around the house. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if: You begin to develop shortness of breath when you are active Shortness of breath gets worse You develop chest pain You develop other symptoms Review Date 2/18/2018 Updated by: Denis Hadjiliadis, MD, MHS, Paul F.

                "document": " Asthma What Is... Espa\u00f1ol Asthma (AZ-ma) is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma. About 7 million of these people are children. Overview To understand asthma, it helps to know how the airways work. The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. People who have asthma have inflamed airways. The inflammation makes the airways swollen and very sensitive. The airways tend to react strongly to certain inhaled substances. When the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. This narrows the airways, causing less air to flow into the lungs. The swelling also can worsen, making the airways even narrower. Cells in the airways might make more mucus than usual. Mucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways. This chain reaction can result in asthma symptoms. Symptoms can happen each time the airways are inflamed. Asthma Sometimes asthma symptoms are mild and go away on their own or after minimal treatment with asthma medicine. Other times, symptoms continue to get worse. When symptoms get more intense and/or more symptoms occur, you're having an asthma attack. Asthma attacks also are called flareups or exacerbations (eg-zas-er-BA-shuns). Treating symptoms when you first notice them is important. This will help prevent the symptoms from worsening and causing a severe asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal. Outlook Asthma has no cure. Even when you feel fine, you still have the disease and it can flare up at any time. However, with today's knowledge and treatments, most people who have asthma are able to manage the disease. They have few, if any, symptoms. They can live normal, active lives and sleep through the night without interruption from asthma. If you have asthma, you can take an active role in managing the disease. For successful, thorough, and ongoing treatment, build strong partnerships with your doctor and other health care providers. Causes The exact cause of asthma isn't known. Researchers think some genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma, most often early in life. These factors include: An inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy (AT-o-pe) Parents who have asthma Certain respiratory infections during childhood Contact with some airborne allergens or exposure to some viral infections in infancy or in early childhood when the immune system is developing If asthma or atopy runs in your family, exposure to irritants (for example, tobacco smoke) may make your airways more reactive to substances in the air. Some factors may be more likely to cause asthma in some people than in others. Researchers continue to explore what causes asthma. The \"Hygiene Hypothesis\" One theory researchers have for what causes asthma is the \"hygiene hypothesis.\" They believe that our Western lifestyle\u2014with its emphasis on hygiene and sanitation\u2014has resulted in changes in our living conditions and an overall decline in infections in early childhood. Many young children no longer have the same types of environmental exposures and infections as children did in the past. This affects the way that young children's immune systems develop during very early childhood, and it may increase their risk for atopy and asthma. This is especially true for children who have close family members with one or both of these conditions. Who Is at Risk Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 22 million people are known to have asthma. Nearly 6 million of these people are children. Young children who often wheeze and have respiratory infections\u2014as well as certain other risk factors\u2014are at highest risk of developing asthma that continues beyond 6 years of age. The other risk factors include having allergies, eczema (an allergic skin condition), or parents who have asthma. Among children, more boys have asthma than girls. But among adults, more women have the disease than men. It's not clear whether or how sex and sex hormones play a role in causing asthma. Most, but not all, people who have asthma have allergies. Some people develop asthma because of contact with certain chemical irritants or industrial dusts in the workplace. This type of asthma is called occupational asthma. Signs & Symptoms Common signs and symptoms of asthma include: Coughing. Coughing from asthma often is worse at night or early in the morning, making it hard to sleep. Wheezing. Wheezing is a whistling or squeaky sound that occurs when you breathe. Chest tightness. This may feel like something is squeezing or sitting on your chest. Shortness of breath. Some people who have asthma say they can't catch their breath or they feel out of breath. You may feel like you can't get air out of your lungs. Not all people who have asthma have these symptoms. Likewise, having these symptoms doesn't always mean that you have asthma. The best way to diagnose asthma for certain is to use a lung function test, a medical history (including type and frequency of symptoms), and a physical exam. The types of asthma symptoms you have, how often they occur, and how severe they are may vary over time. Sometimes your symptoms may just annoy you. Other times, they may be troublesome enough to limit your daily routine. Severe symptoms can be fatal. It's important to treat symptoms when you first notice them so they don't become severe. With proper treatment, most people who have asthma can expect to have few, if any, symptoms either during the day or at night. What Causes Asthma Symptoms To Occur? Many things can trigger or worsen asthma symptoms. Your doctor will help you find out which things (sometimes called triggers) may cause your asthma to flare up if you come in contact with them. Triggers may include: Allergens from dust, animal fur, cockroaches, mold, and pollens from trees, grasses, and flowers Irritants such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, chemicals or dust in the workplace, compounds in home d\u00e9cor products, and sprays (such as hairspray) Medicines such as aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and nonselective beta-blockers Sulfites in foods and drinks Viral upper respiratory infections, such as colds Physical activity, including exercise Other health conditions can make asthma harder to manage. Examples of these conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. These conditions need treatment as part of an overall asthma care plan. Asthma is different for each person. Some of the triggers listed above may not affect you. Other triggers that do affect you may not be on the list. Talk with your doctor about the things that seem to make your asthma worse. Diagnosis Your primary care doctor will diagnose asthma based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthma\u2014that is, whether it's intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe. The level of severity will determine what treatment you'll start on. You may need to see an asthma specialist if: You need special tests to help diagnose asthma You've had a life-threatening asthma attack You need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma, or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled You're thinking about getting allergy treatments Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies. He or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur. Let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places, or if they get worse at night. Your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them. For more information about possible asthma triggers, go to \"What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?\" Your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management. These conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Physical Exam Your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. These signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema). Keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don't have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you. Diagnostic Tests Lung Function Test Your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved. If the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. Other tests may include: Allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any. A test to measure how sensitive your airways are. This is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-KO-prav-eh-KA-shun) test. Using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in. A test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea. A chest x ray or an EKG (electrocardiogram). These tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms. Diagnosing Asthma in Young Children Most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. However, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. This is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions. Also, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old. A child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. The airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds. A young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if: One or both parents have asthma The child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema The child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens The child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection The most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. However, it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. Thus, doctors must rely on children's medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis. Doctors also may use a 4\u20136 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds. Treatments Asthma is a long-term disease that has no cure. The goal of asthma treatment is to control the disease. Good asthma control will: Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath Reduce your need for quick-relief medicines (see below) Help you maintain good lung function Let you maintain your normal activity level and sleep through the night Prevent asthma attacks that could result in an emergency room visit or hospital stay To control asthma, partner with your doctor to manage your asthma or your child's asthma. Children aged 10 or older\u2014and younger children who are able\u2014should take an active role in their asthma care. Taking an active role to control your asthma involves: Working with your doctor to treat other conditions that can interfere with asthma management. Avoiding things that worsen your asthma (asthma triggers). However, one trigger you should not avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active. Working with your doctor and other health care providers to create and follow an asthma action plan. An asthma action plan gives guidance on taking your medicines properly, avoiding asthma triggers (except physical activity), tracking your level of asthma control, responding to worsening symptoms, and seeking emergency care when needed. Asthma is treated with two types of medicines: long-term control and quick-relief medicines. Long-term control medicines help reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms. Quick-relief, or \"rescue,\" medicines relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up. Your initial treatment will depend on the severity of your asthma. Followup asthma treatment will depend on how well your asthma action plan is controlling your symptoms and preventing asthma attacks. Your level of asthma control can vary over time and with changes in your home, school, or work environments. These changes can alter how often you're exposed to the factors that can worsen your asthma. Your doctor may need to increase your medicine if your asthma doesn't stay under control. On the other hand, if your asthma is well controlled for several months, your doctor may decrease your medicine. These adjustments to your medicine will help you maintain the best control possible with the least amount of medicine necessary. Asthma treatment for certain groups of people\u2014such as children, pregnant women, or those for whom exercise brings on asthma symptoms\u2014will be adjusted to meet their special needs. Follow an Asthma Action Plan You can work with your doctor to create a personal asthma action plan. The plan will describe your daily treatments, such as which medicines to take and when to take them. The plan also will explain when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room. If your child has asthma, all of the people who care for him or her should know about the child's asthma action plan. This includes babysitters and workers at daycare centers, schools, and camps. These caretakers can help your child follow his or her action plan. Go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Asthma Action Plan\" for a sample plan. Avoid Things That Can Worsen Your Asthma Many common things (called asthma triggers) can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Once you know what these things are, you can take steps to control many of them. (For more information about asthma triggers, go to \"What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?\") For example, exposure to pollens or air pollution might make your asthma worse. If so, try to limit time outdoors when the levels of these substances in the outdoor air are high. If animal fur triggers your asthma symptoms, keep pets with fur out of your home or bedroom. One possible asthma trigger you shouldn\u2019t avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active. The NHLBI offers many useful tips for controlling asthma triggers. For more information, go to page 2 of NHLBI's \"Asthma Action Plan.\" If your asthma symptoms are clearly related to allergens, and you can't avoid exposure to those allergens, your doctor may advise you to get allergy shots. You may need to see a specialist if you're thinking about getting allergy shots. These shots can lessen or prevent your asthma symptoms, but they can't cure your asthma. Several health conditions can make asthma harder to manage. These conditions include runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Your doctor will treat these conditions as well. Medicines Your doctor will consider many things when deciding which asthma medicines are best for you. He or she will check to see how well a medicine works for you. Then, he or she will adjust the dose or medicine as needed. Asthma medicines can be taken in pill form, but most are taken using a device called an inhaler. An inhaler allows the medicine to go directly to your lungs. Not all inhalers are used the same way. Ask your doctor or another health care provider to show you the right way to use your inhaler. Review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit. Long-Term Control Medicines Most people who have asthma need to take long-term control medicines daily to help prevent symptoms. The most effective long-term medicines reduce airway inflammation, which helps prevent symptoms from starting. These medicines don't give you quick relief from symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred medicine for long-term control of asthma. They're the most effective option for long-term relief of the inflammation and swelling that makes your airways sensitive to certain inhaled substances. Reducing inflammation helps prevent the chain reaction that causes asthma symptoms. Most people who take these medicines daily find they greatly reduce the severity of symptoms and how often they occur. Inhaled corticosteroids generally are safe when taken as prescribed. These medicines are different from the illegal anabolic steroids taken by some athletes. Inhaled corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them every day for many years. Like many other medicines, though, inhaled corticosteroids can have side effects. Most doctors agree that the benefits of taking inhaled corticosteroids and preventing asthma attacks far outweigh the risk of side effects. One common side effect from inhaled corticosteroids is a mouth infection called thrush. You might be able to use a spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler to avoid thrush. These devices attach to your inhaler. They help prevent the medicine from landing in your mouth or on the back of your throat. Check with your doctor to see whether a spacer or holding chamber should be used with the inhaler you have. Also, work with your health care team if you have any questions about how to use a spacer or holding chamber. Rinsing your mouth out with water after taking inhaled corticosteroids also can lower your risk for thrush. If you have severe asthma, you may have to take corticosteroid pills or liquid for short periods to get your asthma under control. If taken for long periods, these medicines raise your risk for cataracts and osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis). A cataract is the clouding of the lens in your eye. Osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break. Your doctor may have you add another long-term asthma control medicine so he or she can lower your dose of corticosteroids. Or, your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin D pills to protect your bones. Other long-term control medicines. Other long-term control medicines include: Cromolyn. This medicine is taken using a device called a nebulizer. As you breathe in, the nebulizer sends a fine mist of medicine to your lungs. Cromolyn helps prevent airway inflammation. Omalizumab (anti-IgE). This medicine is given as a shot (injection) one or two times a month. It helps prevent your body from reacting to asthma triggers, such as pollen and dust mites. Anti-IgE might be used if other asthma medicines have not worked well. A rare, but possibly life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis might occur when the Omalizumab injection is given. If you take this medication, work with your doctor to make sure you understand the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and what actions you should take. Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists. These medicines open the airways. They might be added to inhaled corticosteroids to improve asthma control. Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists should never be used on their own for long-term asthma control. They must used with inhaled corticosteroids. Leukotriene modifiers. These medicines are taken by mouth. They help block the chain reaction that increases inflammation in your airways. Theophylline. This medicine is taken by mouth. Theophylline helps open the airways. If your doctor prescribes a long-term control medicine, take it every day to control your asthma. Your asthma symptoms will likely return or get worse if you stop taking your medicine. Long-term control medicines can have side effects. Talk with your doctor about these side effects and ways to reduce or avoid them. With some medicines, like theophylline, your doctor will check the level of medicine in your blood. This helps ensure that you\u2019re getting enough medicine to relieve your asthma symptoms, but not so much that it causes dangerous side effects. Quick-Relief Medicines All people who have asthma need quick-relief medicines to help relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists are the first choice for quick relief. These medicines act quickly to relax tight muscles around your airways when you're having a flareup. This allows the airways to open up so air can flow through them. You should take your quick-relief medicine when you first notice asthma symptoms. If you use this medicine more than 2 days a week, talk with your doctor about your asthma control. You may need to make changes to your asthma action plan. Carry your quick-relief inhaler with you at all times in case you need it. If your child has asthma, make sure that anyone caring for him or her has the child's quick-relief medicines, including staff at the child's school. They should understand when and how to use these medicines and when to seek medical care for your child. You shouldn't use quick-relief medicines in place of prescribed long-term control medicines. Quick-relief medicines don't reduce inflammation. Track Your Asthma To track your asthma, keep records of your symptoms, check your peak flow number using a peak flow meter, and get regular asthma checkups. Record Your Symptoms You can record your asthma symptoms in a diary to see how well your treatments are controlling your asthma. Asthma is well controlled if: You have symptoms no more than 2 days a week, and these symptoms don't wake you from sleep more than 1 or 2 nights a month. You can do all your normal activities. You take quick-relief medicines no more than 2 days a week. You have no more than one asthma attack a year that requires you to take corticosteroids by mouth. Your peak flow doesn't drop below 80 percent of your personal best number. If your asthma isn't well controlled, contact your doctor. He or she may need to change your asthma action plan. Use a Peak Flow Meter This small, hand-held device shows how well air moves out of your lungs. You blow into the device and it gives you a score, or peak flow number. Your score shows how well your lungs are working at the time of the test. Your doctor will tell you how and when to use your peak flow meter. He or she also will teach you how to take your medicines based on your score. Your doctor and other health care providers may ask you to use your peak flow meter each morning and keep a record of your results. You may find it very useful to record peak flow scores for a couple of weeks before each medical visit and take the results with you. When you're first diagnosed with asthma, it's important to find your \"personal best\" peak flow number. To do this, you record your score each day for a 2- to 3-week period when your asthma is well-controlled. The highest number you get during that time is your personal best. You can compare this number to future numbers to make sure your asthma is controlled. Your peak flow meter can help warn you of an asthma attack, even before you notice symptoms. If your score shows that your breathing is getting worse, you should take your quick-relief medicines the way your asthma action plan directs. Then you can use the peak flow meter to check how well the medicine worked. Get Asthma Checkups When you first begin treatment, you'll see your doctor about every 2 to 6 weeks. Once your asthma is controlled, your doctor may want to see you from once a month to twice a year. During these checkups, your doctor may ask whether you've had an asthma attack since the last visit or any changes in symptoms or peak flow measurements. He or she also may ask about your daily activities. This information will help your doctor assess your level of asthma control. Your doctor also may ask whether you have any problems or concerns with taking your medicines or following your asthma action plan. Based on your answers to these questions, your doctor may change the dose of your medicine or give you a new medicine. If your control is very good, you might be able to take less medicine. The goal is to use the least amount of medicine needed to control your asthma. Emergency Care Most people who have asthma, including many children, can safely manage their symptoms by following their asthma action plans. However, you might need medical attention at times. Call your doctor for advice if: Your medicines don't relieve an asthma attack. Your peak flow is less than half of your personal best peak flow number. Call 9\u20131\u20131 for emergency care if: You have trouble walking and talking because you're out of breath. You have blue lips or fingernails. At the hospital, you'll be closely watched and given oxygen and more medicines, as well as medicines at higher doses than you take at home. Such treatment can save your life. Asthma Treatment for Special Groups The treatments described above generally apply to all people who have asthma. However, some aspects of treatment differ for people in certain age groups and those who have special needs. Children It's hard to diagnose asthma in children younger than 5 years. Thus, it's hard to know whether young children who wheeze or have other asthma symptoms will benefit from long-term control medicines. (Quick-relief medicines tend to relieve wheezing in young children whether they have asthma or not.) Doctors will treat infants and young children who have asthma symptoms with long-term control medicines if, after assessing a child, they feel that the symptoms are persistent and likely to continue after 6 years of age. (For more information, go to \"How Is Asthma Diagnosed?\") Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for young children. Montelukast and cromolyn are other options. Treatment might be given for a trial period of 1 month to 6 weeks. Treatment usually is stopped if benefits aren't seen during that time and the doctor and parents are confident the medicine was used properly. Inhaled corticosteroids can possibly slow the growth of children of all ages. Slowed growth usually is apparent in the first several months of treatment, is generally small, and doesn't get worse over time. Poorly controlled asthma also may reduce a child's growth rate. Many experts think the benefits of inhaled corticosteroids for children who need them to control their asthma far outweigh the risk of slowed growth. Older Adults Doctors may need to adjust asthma treatment for older adults who take certain other medicines, such as beta blockers, aspirin and other pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory medicines. These medicines can prevent asthma medicines from working well and may worsen asthma symptoms. Be sure to tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines. Older adults may develop weak bones from using inhaled corticosteroids, especially at high doses. Talk with your doctor about taking calcium and vitamin D pills, as well as other ways to help keep your bones strong. Pregnant Women Pregnant women who have asthma need to control the disease to ensure a good supply of oxygen to their babies. Poor asthma control increases the risk of preeclampsia, a condition in which a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Poor asthma control also increases the risk that a baby will be born early and have a low birth weight. Studies show that it's safer to take asthma medicines while pregnant than to risk having an asthma attack. Talk with your doctor if you have asthma and are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Your level of asthma control may get better or it may get worse while you're pregnant. Your health care team will check your asthma control often and adjust your treatment as needed. People Whose Asthma Symptoms Occur With Physical Activity Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Adults need physical activity to maintain good health. Children need it for growth and development. In some people, however, physical activity can trigger asthma symptoms. If this happens to you or your child, talk with your doctor about the best ways to control asthma so you can stay active. The following medicines may help prevent asthma symptoms caused by physical activity: Short-acting beta2-agonists (quick-relief medicine) taken shortly before physical activity can last 2 to 3 hours and prevent exercise-related symptoms in most people who take them. Long-acting beta2-agonists can be protective for up to 12 hours. However, with daily use, they'll no longer give up to 12 hours of protection. Also, frequent use of these medicines for physical activity might be a sign that asthma is poorly controlled. Leukotriene modifiers. These pills are taken several hours before physical activity. They can help relieve asthma symptoms brought on by physical activity. Long-term control medicines. Frequent or severe symptoms due to physical activity may suggest poorly controlled asthma and the need to either start or increase long-term control medicines that reduce inflammation. This will help prevent exercise-related symptoms. Easing into physical activity with a warmup period may be helpful. You also may want to wear a mask or scarf over your mouth when exercising in cold weather. If you use your asthma medicines as your doctor directs, you should be able to take part in any physical activity or sport you choose. People Having Surgery Asthma may add to the risk of having problems during and after surgery. For instance, having a tube put into your throat may cause an asthma attack. Tell your surgeon about your asthma when you first talk with him or her. The surgeon can take steps to lower your risk, such as giving you asthma medicines before or during surgery. Prevention You can\u2019t prevent asthma. However, you can take steps to control the disease and prevent its symptoms. For example: Learn about your asthma and ways to control it. Follow your written asthma action plan. (For a sample plan, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Asthma Action Plan.\") Use medicines as your doctor prescribes. Identify and try to avoid things that make your asthma worse (asthma triggers). However, one trigger you should not avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active. Keep track of your asthma symptoms and level of control. Get regular checkups for your asthma. For more details about how to prevent asthma symptoms and attacks, go to \"How Is Asthma Treated and Controlled?\" Living With If you have asthma, you\u2019ll need long-term care. Successful asthma treatment requires that you take an active role in your care and follow your asthma action plan. Learn How To Manage Your Asthma Partner with your doctor to develop an asthma action plan. This plan will help you know when and how to take your medicines. The plan also will help you identify your asthma triggers and manage your disease if asthma symptoms worsen. Children aged 10 or older\u2014and younger children who can handle it\u2014should be involved in creating and following their asthma action plans. For a sample plan, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Asthma Action Plan.\" Most people who have asthma can successfully manage their symptoms by following their asthma action plans and having regular checkups. However, knowing when to seek emergency medical care is important. Learn how to use your medicines correctly. If you take inhaled medicines, you should practice using your inhaler at your doctor's office. If you take long-term control medicines, take them daily as your doctor prescribes. Record your asthma symptoms as a way to track how well your asthma is controlled. Also, your doctor may advise you to use a peak flow meter to measure and record how well your lungs are working. Your doctor may ask you to keep records of your symptoms or peak flow results daily for a couple of weeks before an office visit. You'll bring these records with you to the visit. (For more information about using a peak flow meter, go to \"How Is Asthma Treated and Controlled?\") These steps will help you keep track of how well you're controlling your asthma over time. This will help you spot problems early and prevent or relieve asthma attacks. Recording your symptoms and peak flow results to share with your doctor also will help him or her decide whether to adjust your treatment. Ongoing Care Have regular asthma checkups with your doctor so he or she can assess your level of asthma control and adjust your treatment as needed. Remember, the main goal of asthma treatment is to achieve the best control of your asthma using the least amount of medicine. This may require frequent adjustments to your treatments. If you find it hard to follow your asthma action plan or the plan isn't working well, let your health care team know right away. They will work with you to adjust your plan to better suit your needs. Get treatment for any other conditions that can interfere with your asthma management. Watch for Signs That Your Asthma Is Getting Worse Your asthma might be getting worse if: Your symptoms start to occur more often, are more severe, or bother you at night and cause you to lose sleep. You're limiting your normal activities and missing school or work because of your asthma. Your peak flow number is low compared to your personal best or varies a lot from day to day. Your asthma medicines don't seem to work well anymore. You have to use your quick-relief inhaler more often. If you're using quick-relief medicine more than 2 days a week, your asthma isn't well controlled. You have to go to the emergency room or doctor because of an asthma attack. If you have any of these signs, see your doctor. He or she might need to change your medicines or take other steps to control your asthma. Partner with your health care team and take an active role in your care. This can help you better control your asthma so it doesn't interfere with your activities and disrupt your life. ",

                "document": " Generalized anxiety disorder Overview It's normal to feel anxious from time to time, especially if your life is stressful. However, excessive, ongoing anxiety and worry that are difficult to control and interfere with day-to-day activities may be a sign of generalized anxiety disorder. It's possible to develop generalized anxiety disorder as a child or an adult. Generalized anxiety disorder has symptoms that are similar to panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other types of anxiety, but they're all different conditions. Living with generalized anxiety disorder can be a long-term challenge. In many cases, it occurs along with other anxiety or mood disorders. In most cases, generalized anxiety disorder improves with psychotherapy or medications. Making lifestyle changes, learning coping skills and using relaxation techniques also can help. Generalized anxiety disorder care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms can vary. They may include: - Persistent worrying or anxiety about a number of areas that are out of proportion to the impact of the events - Overthinking plans and solutions to all possible worst-case outcomes - Perceiving situations and events as threatening, even when they aren't - Difficulty handling uncertainty - Indecisiveness and fear of making the wrong decision - Inability to set aside or let go of a worry - Inability to relax, feeling restless, and feeling keyed up or on edge - Difficulty concentrating, or the feeling that your mind \"goes blank\" Physical signs and symptoms may include: - Fatigue - Trouble sleeping - Muscle tension or muscle aches - Trembling, feeling twitchy - Nervousness or being easily startled - Sweating - Nausea, diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome - Irritability There may be times when your worries don't completely consume you, but you still feel anxious even when there's no apparent reason. For example, you may feel intense worry about your safety or that of your loved ones, or you may have a general sense that something bad is about to happen. Your anxiety, worry or physical symptoms cause you significant distress in social, work or other areas of your life. Worries can shift from one concern to another and may change with time and age. Children and teenagers may have similar worries to adults, but also may have excessive worries about: - Performance at school or sporting events - Family members' safety - Being on time (punctuality) - Earthquakes, nuclear war or other catastrophic events A child or teen with excessive worry may: - Feel overly anxious to fit in - Be a perfectionist - Redo tasks because they aren't perfect the first time - Spend excessive time doing homework - Lack confidence - Strive for approval - Require a lot of reassurance about performance - Have frequent stomachaches or other physical complaints - Avoid going to school or avoid social situations Some anxiety is normal, but see your doctor if: - You feel like you're worrying too much, and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life - You feel depressed or irritable, have trouble with drinking or drugs, or you have other mental health concerns along with anxiety - You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors - seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries are unlikely to simply go away on their own, and they may actually get worse over time. Try to seek professional help before your anxiety becomes severe - it may be easier to treat early on. Causes As with many mental health conditions, the cause of generalized anxiety disorder likely arises from a complex interaction of biological and environmental factors, which may include: - Differences in brain chemistry and function - Genetics - Differences in the way threats are perceived - Development and personality Risk factors Women are diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder somewhat more often than men are. The following factors may increase the risk of developing generalized anxiety disorder: - Personality. A person whose temperament is timid or negative or who avoids anything dangerous may be more prone to generalized anxiety disorder than others are. - Genetics. Generalized anxiety disorder may run in families. - Experiences. People with generalized anxiety disorder may have a history of significant life changes, traumatic or negative experiences during childhood, or a recent traumatic or negative event. Chronic medical illnesses or other mental health disorders may increase risk. Complications Having generalized anxiety disorder can be disabling. It can: - Impair your ability to perform tasks quickly and efficiently because you have trouble concentrating - Take your time and focus from other activities - Sap your energy - Increase your risk of depression Generalized anxiety disorder can also lead to or worsen other physical health conditions, such as: - Digestive or bowel problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome or ulcers - Headaches and migraines - Chronic pain and illness - Sleep problems and insomnia - Heart-health issues Generalized anxiety disorder often occurs along with other mental health problems, which can make diagnosis and treatment more challenging. Some mental health disorders that commonly occur with generalized anxiety disorder include: - Phobias - Panic disorder - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) - Depression - Suicidal thoughts or suicide - Substance abuse Diagnosis To help diagnose generalized anxiety disorder, your doctor or mental health professional may: - Do a physical exam to look for signs that your anxiety might be linked to medications or an underlying medical condition - Order blood or urine tests or other tests, if a medical condition is suspected - Ask detailed questions about your symptoms and medical history - Use psychological questionnaires to help determine a diagnosis - Use the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association Treatment Treatment decisions are based on how significantly generalized anxiety disorder is affecting your ability to function in your daily life. The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective form of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder. Generally a short-term treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on teaching you specific skills to directly manage your worries and help you gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. Through this process, your symptoms improve as you build on your initial success. Medications Several types of medications are used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects. - Antidepressants. Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments. Examples of antidepressants used to treat generalized anxiety disorder include escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva). Your doctor also may recommend other antidepressants. - Buspirone. An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be used on an ongoing basis. As with most antidepressants, it typically takes up to several weeks to become fully effective. - Benzodiazepines. In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepine for relief of anxiety symptoms. These sedatives are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these medications aren't a good choice if you have or had problems with alcohol or drug abuse. Lifestyle and home remedies While most people with anxiety disorders need psychotherapy or medications to get anxiety under control, lifestyle changes also can make a difference. Here's what you can do: - Keep physically active. Develop a routine so that you're physically active most days of the week. Exercise is a powerful stress reducer. It may improve your mood and help you stay healthy. Start out slowly and gradually increase the amount and intensity of your activities. - Make sleep a priority. Do what you can to make sure you're getting enough sleep to feel rested. If you aren't sleeping well, see your doctor. - Use relaxation techniques. Visualization techniques, meditation and yoga are examples of relaxation techniques that can ease anxiety. - Eat healthy. Healthy eating - such as focusing on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and fish - may be linked to reduced anxiety, but more research is needed. - Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs. These substances can worsen anxiety. - Quit smoking and cut back or quit drinking coffee. Both nicotine and caffeine can worsen anxiety. Alternative medicine Several herbal remedies have been studied as treatments for anxiety. Results tend to be mixed, and in several studies people report no benefits from their use. More research is needed to fully understand the risks and benefits. Some herbal supplements, such as kava and valerian, increase the risk of serious liver damage. Other supplements, such as passionflower or theanine, may have a calming effect, but they're often combined with other products so it's hard to tell whether they help with symptoms of anxiety. Before taking any herbal remedies or supplements, talk with your doctor to make sure they're safe and won't interact with any medications you take. ",

                "document": " Klinefelter syndrome Klinefelter's syndrome XXY syndrome 47,XXY syndrome Summary Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a condition that occurs in males when they have an extra X chromosome . Some males with KS have no obvious signs or symptoms while others may have varying degrees of cognitive, social, behavioral, and learning difficulties. Adults with Klinefelter syndrome may also have primary hypogonadism (decreased testosterone production), small and/or undescendent testes (cryptorchidism), enlarged breast tissue ( gynecomastia ), tall stature, and/or inability to have biological children (infertility), as well as an abnormal opening of the penis (hypospadias), and an small penis (micropenis). KS is not inherited , but usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) that results in the presence of one extra copy of the X chromosome in each cell (47,XXY). KS treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. [1] [2] [3] Life expectancy is usually normal and many people with KS have normal life. There is a very small risk of developing breast cancer and other conditions such as a chronic inflammatory disease called systemic lupus erythematosus. [3] In some cases, there is more than one X chromosome in each cell (for example, 48,XXXY or 49,XXXXY). These conditions, which are often called \"variants of Klinefelter\" syndrome usually have more serious problems ( intellectual disability , skeletal problems, and poor coordination) than classic Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY). [3] Symptoms The signs and symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome (KS) vary among affected people. Some men with KS have no symptoms of the condition or are only mildy affected. In these cases, they may not even know that they are affected by KS. When present, symptoms may include: [1] [2] [3] Small, firm testicles Delayed or incomplete puberty with lack of secondary sexual characteristics resulting in sparse facial, body, or sexual hair a high-pitched voice and body fat distribution resulting in a rounder, lower half of the body, with more fat deposited in the hips, buttocks and thigh instead of around the chest and abdomen Breast growth ( gynecomastia ) Reduced facial and body hair Infertility Tall stature Abnormal body proportions (long legs, short trunk, shoulder equal to hip size) Learning disablity Speech delay Crypthochirdism Opening (meatus) of the urethra (the tube that carries urine and sperm through the penis to the outside) on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) instead of the tip of the head of the penis Social, psychologic and behavioral problems Whether or not a male with KS has visible symptoms depends on many factors, including how much testosterone his body makes, if he is mosaic (with both XY and XXY cells ), and his age when the condition is diagnosed and treated. [1] Some people have a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer , a rare extragonadal germ cell tumor, lung disease, varicose veins and osteoporosis as well as some autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome. [2] [4] Some people with features of Klinefelter syndrome have more than one extra X chromosome in each cell (such as 48,XXXY or 49,XXXXY). In these cases, known as \"variants of Klinefelter syndrome\", the signs and symptoms can be more severe and may include: [1] [2] [4] Intellectual disability Distinctive facial features Skeletal abnormalities Poor coordination Severe speech difficulties Behavioral problems Heart defects Teeth problems. Cause Klinefelter syndrome usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes . For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain one or more extra copies of the X chromosome as a result of nondisjunction. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have one or more extra X chromosomes in each of the body's cells. [2] Most often, Klinefelter syndrome is caused by a single extra copy of the X chromosome, resulting in a total of 47 chromosomes per cell. Males normally have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell (46, XY), while females have two X chromosomes (46, XX). People with Klinefelter syndrome usually have two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome (47, XXY). Some people with Klinefelter syndrome have the extra X chromosome in only some of their cells; these people are said to have mosaic Klinefelter syndrome. [2] It is estimated that about half of the time, the cell division error occurs during development of the sperm, while the remainder are due to errors in egg development. Women who have pregnancies after age 35 have a slightly increased chance of having offspring with this syndrome. [5] The features of Klinefelter syndrome are due to the extra copies of genes on the extra X chromosome, which can alter male sexual development. [3] Some people with features of Klinefelter syndrome have conditions known as \"variants of Klinefelter syndrome\" where there is more than one extra sex chromosome in each cell ( 48,XXXY, 48,XXYY and 49,XXXXY). [5] Inheritance Klinefelter syndrome is not inherited , but usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction can result in reproductive cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes . For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain one or more extra copies of the X chromosome as a result of nondisjunction. If one of these reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have one or several extra X chromosomes in each of the body's cells. [2] Diagnosis A diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. This generally includes a chromosomal analysis (called a karyotype ). [3] [6] It is also possible to diagnosis Klinefelter syndrome before birth through chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis . [6] Treatment Because symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome (KS) can sometimes be very mild, many people are never diagnosed or treated. When a diagnosis is made, treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person, especially the problems related to hypogonadism , gynecomastia , and psychosocial problems. Treatment may include: [1] [3] [4] Testosterone replacement: About half of people with SK have low testosterone levels, which may be raised by taking supplemental testosterone. Having a more normal testosterone level can help affected people develop bigger muscles, a deeper voice, and facial and body hair, and may also increase sexual desire, enlarge the testes , improve mood, self-image, and behavior; it may also protect against osteoporosis and decrease the risks of autoimmune disease and breast cancer . Breast removal or reduction surgery. Educational interventions: As children, many people with Klinefelter syndrome qualify for special services to help them in school. Teachers can also help by using certain methods in the classroom, such as breaking bigger tasks into small steps. Several forms of therapy such as physical, speech, occupational, behavioral, mental health, and family therapy can often help reduce or eliminate some of the symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome such as poor muscle tone; speech and language problems; or low self-confidence. Prognosis Babies with the 47, XXY form of Klinefelter differ little from healthy children. The results of one study on non- mosaic XXY infants younger than 2 years indicated that most XXY babies had normal external genitalia and facial features with height and weight in the normal range. Genetic testing had been performed due to a delay in walking and/or speech. Early diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome is shown to be important to monitor potential developmental problems. [4] Boys with the 47, XXY karyotype may struggle through adolescence with academics, various frustrations, and, in a few instances, serious emotional or behavioral difficulties. However, most move toward full independence from their families as they enter adulthood. Some have completed graduate education and have a normal level of functioning. Lifespan is not affected by Klinefelter syndrome. [4] Statistics It is estimated that 1 in every 500 to 1,000 newborn males has an extra X chromosome, making Klinefelter syndrome one of the most common chromosomal disorders seen among newborns. Variants of Klinefelter syndrome (such as 48,XXXY, 49,XXXXY) are much rarer, occurring in 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 85,000 or fewer newborns. [1] [7] It is suspected that Klinefelter syndrome is underdiagnosed because mild cases may not be identified. In addition, the features of this condition vary and can overlap significantly with those of other conditions. [7] ",

                "document": " Ibuprofen IMPORTANT WARNING: People who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (other than aspirin) such as ibuprofen may have a higher risk of having a heart attack or a stroke than people who do not take these medications. These events may happen without warning and may cause death. This risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time. Do not take an NSAID such as ibuprofen if you have recently had a heart attack, unless directed to do so by your doctor. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had heart disease, a heart attack, or a stroke; if you smoke; and if you have or have ever had high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes. Get emergency medical help right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness in one part or side of the body, or slurred speech. If you will be undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG; a type of heart surgery), you should not take ibuprofen right before or right after the surgery. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen may cause ulcers, bleeding, or holes in the stomach or intestine. These problems may develop at any time during treatment, may happen without warning symptoms, and may cause death. The risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time, are older in age, have poor health, or who drink three or more alcoholic drinks per day while taking ibuprofen. Tell your doctor if you take any of the following medications: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); aspirin; other NSAIDs such as ketoprofen and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); oral steroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Rayos); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, Selfemra, in Symbyax), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Brisdelle, Paxil, Pexeva), and sertraline (Zoloft); or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as desvenlafaxine (Khedezla, Pristiq), duloxetine (Cymbalta), and venlafaxine (Effexor XR). Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had ulcers, bleeding in your stomach or intestines, or other bleeding disorders. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking ibuprofen and call your doctor: stomach pain, heartburn, vomit that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, blood in the stool, or black and tarry stools. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will monitor your symptoms carefully and will probably order certain tests to check your body's response to ibuprofen. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling so that your doctor can prescribe the right amount of medication to treat your condition with the lowest risk of serious side effects. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with prescription ibuprofen and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Why is this medication prescribed? Prescription ibuprofen is used to relieve pain, tenderness, swelling, and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by a breakdown of the lining of the joints) and rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis caused by swelling of the lining of the joints). It is also used to relieve mild to moderate pain, including menstrual pain (pain that happens before or during a menstrual period). Nonprescription ibuprofen is used to reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pain from headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, menstrual periods, the common cold, toothaches, and backaches. Ibuprofen is in a class of medications called NSAIDs. It works by stopping the body's production of a substance that causes pain, fever, and inflammation. How should this medicine be used? Prescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day for arthritis or every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Nonprescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, suspension (liquid), and drops (concentrated liquid). Adults and children older than 12 years of age may usually take nonprescription ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain or fever. Children and infants may usually be given nonprescription ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain or fever, but should not be given more than 4 doses in 24 hours. Ibuprofen may be taken with food or milk to prevent stomach upset. If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, you should take it at the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ibuprofen exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor. Ibuprofen comes alone and in combination with other medications. Some of these combination products are available by prescription only, and some of these combination products are available without a prescription and are used to treat cough and cold symptoms and other conditions. If your doctor has prescribed a medication that contains ibuprofen, you should be careful not to take any nonprescription medications that also contain ibuprofen. If you are selecting a product to treat cough or cold symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for you. Check nonprescription product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child. Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain ibuprofen, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully. If you are giving ibuprofen or a combination product that contains ibuprofen to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give ibuprofen products that are made for adults to children. Before you give an ibuprofen product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child. Shake the suspension and drops well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the measuring cup provided to measure each dose of the suspension, and use the dosing device provided to measure each dose of the drops. The chewable tablets may cause a burning feeling in the mouth or throat. Take the chewable tablets with food or water. Stop taking nonprescription ibuprofen and call your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you develop new or unexpected symptoms, the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen, your pain lasts for more than 10 days, or your fever lasts more than 3 days. Stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child does not start to feel better during the first 24 hours of treatment. Also stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling on the painful part of his body, or if your child's pain or fever get worse or lasts longer than 3 days. Do not give nonprescription ibuprofen to a child who has a sore throat that is severe or does not go away, or that comes along with fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting. Call the child's doctor right away, because these symptoms may be signs of a more serious condition. Other uses for this medicine Ibuprofen is also sometimes used to treat ankylosing spondylitis (arthritis that mainly affects the spine), gouty arthritis (joint pain caused by a build-up of certain substances in the joints), and psoriatic arthritis (arthritis that occurs with a long-lasting skin disease that causes scaling and swelling). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this drug for your condition. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

Some types of nonprescription ibuprofen may be sweetened with aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. What special dietary instructions should I follow? Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet. What should I do if I forget a dose? If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication? Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community. See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website (http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location - one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org In case of emergency/overdose In case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222.

Cells scraped from the opening of the cervix are examined under a microscope. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. This test is sometimes called a Pap smear. How the Test is Performed You lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups. The health care provider gently places an instrument called a speculum into the vagina to open it slightly. This allows the provider to see inside the vagina and cervix. Cells are gently scraped from the cervix area. The sample of cells is sent to a lab for examination. How to Prepare for the Test Tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking. Some birth control pills that contain estrogen or progestin may affect test results. Also tell your provider if you: Have had an abnormal Pap test Might be pregnant DO NOT do the following for 24 hours before the test: Douche (douching should never be done) Have intercourse Use tampons Avoid scheduling your Pap test while you have your period (are menstruating). Blood may make the Pap test results less accurate. If you are having unexpected bleeding, do not cancel your exam. Your provider will determine if the Pap test can still be done. Empty your bladder just before the test. How the Test will Feel A Pap test causes little to no discomfort for most women. It can cause some discomfort, similar to menstrual cramps. You may also feel some pressure during the exam. You may bleed a little bit after the test. Why the Test is Performed The Pap test is a screening test for cervical cancer. Most cervical cancers can be detected early if a woman has routine Pap tests. Screening should start at age 21. After the first test: You should have a Pap test every 3 years to check for cervical cancer. If you are over age 30 and you also have HPV testing done, and both the Pap test and HPV test are normal, you can be tested every 5 years (HPV is the human papillomavirus, the virus that causes genital warts and cervical cancer). Most women can stop having Pap tests after age 65 to 70 as long as they have had 3 negative tests within the past 10 years. You may not need to have a Pap test if you have had a total hysterectomy (uterus and cervix removed) and have not had an abnormal Pap test, cervical cancer, or other pelvic cancer. Discuss this with your provider. Normal Results A normal result means there are no abnormal cells present. The Pap test is not 100% accurate. Cervical cancer may be missed in a small number of cases. Most of the time, cervical cancer develops very slowly, and follow-up Pap tests should find any changes in time for treatment. What Abnormal Results Mean Abnormal results are grouped as follows: ASCUS or AGUS: This result means there are atypical cells, but it is uncertain or unclear what these changes mean. The changes may be due to HPV. They may also mean there are changes that may lead to cancer. These cells could be precancerous and they could be coming from the outside of the cervix or inside the uterus. LOW-GRADE DYSPLASIA (LSIL) OR HIGH-GRADE DYSPLASIA (HSIL): This means changes that may lead to cancer are present. The risk of progression to cervical cancer is greater with HSIL. CARCINOMA IN SITU (CIS): This result most often means the abnormal changes are likely to lead to cervical cancer if not treated ATYPICAL SQUAMOUS CELLS (ASC): Abnormal changes have been found and may be HSIL ATYPICAL GLANDULAR CELLS (AGC): Cell changes that may lead to cancer are seen in the upper part of the cervical canal or inside the uterus. When a Pap test shows abnormal changes, further testing or follow-up is needed. The next step depends on the results of the Pap test, your previous history of Pap tests, and risk factors you may have for cervical cancer. For minor cell changes, providers will recommend another Pap test or repeat HPV testing in 6 to 12 months. Follow-up testing or treatment may include: Colposcopy-directed biopsy -- Colposcopy is a procedure in which the cervix is magnified with a binocular like tool called a colposcope. Small biopsies are often obtained during this procedure to determine the extent of the problem. An HPV test to check for the presence of the HPV virus types most likely to cause cancer.

                "document": " Generalized anxiety disorder - self-care GAD - self-care Anxiety - self-care Anxiety disorder - self-care Summary Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental condition in which you're frequently worried or anxious about many things. Even when there is no clear cause, you're still not able to control your anxiety. The right treatment can often improve GAD. You and your health care provider should make a treatment plan that could include talk therapy (psychotherapy), taking medicine, or both. Taking Medicine Your provider may prescribe one or more medicines, including: An antidepressant, which can help with anxiety and depression. This kind of medicine may take weeks to start working. It is a safe medium- to long-term treatment for GAD. A benzodiazepine, which acts faster than an antidepressant to control anxiety. But it can become less effective over time. Your provider may prescribe a benzodiazepine to help your anxiety while you wait for the antidepressant to work. Also, benzodiazepines may become habit forming over time. When taking medicine for GAD: Keep your provider informed about your symptoms. If a medicine isn't controlling symptoms, its dosage may need to be changed, or you may need to try a new medicine instead. DO NOT change the dosage or stop taking the medicine without talking to your provider. Take medicine at set times. For example, take it every day at breakfast. Check with your provider about the best time to take your medicine. Ask your provider about side effects and what to do if they occur. Therapy Talk therapy takes place with a trained therapist and in a safe place. It helps you learn ways of managing and reducing your anxiety. Some forms of talk therapy can help you understand what causes your anxiety. This allows you to gain better control over it. Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, your behaviors, and your symptoms. Often CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to: Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people's behavior or life events. Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control. Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur. Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones. Your provider can discuss talk therapy options with you. Then you can decide together if it is right for you. Other Ways to Manage Your Anxiety Taking medicine and going to talk therapy can get you started on the road to feeling better. It can also help you take care of your body and relationships. To help improve your condition: Get enough sleep. Eat healthy foods. Keep a regular daily schedule. Get out of the house every day. Exercise every day. Even a little bit of exercise, such as a 15-minute walk, can help. Stay away from alcohol and street drugs. Talk with family or friends when you feel nervous or frightened. Find out about different types of group activities you can join. When to Call the Doctor Call your provider if you: Find it hard to control your anxiety Do not sleep well Feel sad or feel like you want to hurt yourself Have physical symptoms from your anxiety Review Date 5/12/2017 Updated by: Fred K.

                "document": " Prostate cancer treatment Summary Treatment for your prostate cancer is chosen after a thorough evaluation. Your health care provider will discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment. Sometimes your provider may recommend one treatment for you because of your type of cancer and risk factors. Other times, there may be two or more treatments that could be good for you. Factors you and your provider must think about include: Your age and other medical problems you may have Side effects that occur with each type of treatment How much the prostate cancer has spread Your Gleason score, which tells how likely it is that cancer has already spread Your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result Ask your provider to explain these things following about your treatment choices: Which choices offer the best chance of curing your cancer or controlling its spread? How likely is it that you will have different side effects, and how they will affect your life? Radical Prostatectomy (Prostate Removal) Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue. It is an option when the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland. Healthy men who will likely live 10 or more years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer often have this procedure. Be aware that it is not always possible to know for certain, before surgery, if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland. Possible problems after surgery include difficulty controlling urine and erection problems. Also, some men need further treatments after this surgery. Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy works best for treating prostate cancer that has not spread outside of the prostate. It may also be used after surgery if there is a risk that cancer cells are still present. Radiation is sometimes used for pain relief when cancer has spread to the bone. External beam radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays pointed at the prostate gland: Before treatment, the radiation therapist uses a special pen to mark the part of the body that is to be treated. Radiation is delivered to the prostate gland using a machine similar to a regular x-ray machine. The treatment itself is usually painless. Treatment is done in a radiation oncology center that is usually connected to a hospital. Treatment is usually done 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks. Side effects may include: Appetite loss Diarrhea Erection problems Fatigue Rectal burning or injury Skin reactions Urinary incontinence, the feeling of needing to urinate urgently, or blood in the urine There are reports of secondary cancers arising from the radiation as well. Proton therapy is another kind of radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer. Proton beams target the tumor precisely, so there is less damage to the surrounding tissue. This therapy is not widely accepted or used. Prostate Brachytherapy Brachytherapy is often used for small prostate cancers that are found early and are slow-growing. Brachytherapy may be combined with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced cancers. Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive seeds inside the prostate gland. A surgeon inserts small needles through the skin beneath your scrotum to inject the seeds. The seeds are so small that you do not feel them. The seeds are left in place permanently. Side effects may include: Pain, swelling, or bruising in the penis or scrotum Red-brown urine or semen Impotence Incontinence Urinary retention Diarrhea Hormonal Therapy Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer. Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer. The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist: The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months. Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence. The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug: It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone. Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts. Much of the body's testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (medicine that helps the body's immune system fight the cancer) may be used to treat prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone treatment. Usually a single drug or a combination of drugs is recommended. Cryotherapy Cryotherapy uses very cold temperatures to freeze and kill prostate cancer cells. The goal of cryosurgery is to destroy the entire prostate gland and possibly surrounding tissue. Cryosurgery is generally not used as a first treatment for prostate cancer.

                "document": " Diabetes Overview Diabetes is a disease in which blood sugar (glucose) levels in your body are too high. Diabetes can cause serious health problems, including heart attack or stroke, blindness, problems during pregnancy, and kidney failure. More than 13 million women have diabetes, or about one in 10 women ages 20 and older.1 What is diabetes? Diabetes is a disease caused by high levels of blood sugar (glucose) in your body. This can happen when your body does not make insulin or does not use insulin correctly. Insulin is a hormone made in the pancreas, an organ near your stomach. Insulin helps the glucose from food get into your body's cells for energy. If your body does not make enough insulin, or your body does not use the insulin correctly, the glucose stays and builds up in your blood. Over time, this extra glucose can lead to prediabetes or diabetes. Diabetes puts you at risk for other serious and life-threatening health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, and kidney damage. What are the different types of diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are: Am I at risk for diabetes? A risk factor is something that puts you at a higher risk for a disease compared with an average person. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes in women and girls include: Risk factors for type 2 diabetes in women and girls include:4 If you have any of these risk factors, talk to your doctor about ways to lower your risk for diabetes. You can also take the Diabetes Risk Test and talk about the results with your doctor. Who gets diabetes? Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood, but it can happen at any age. It is more common in whites than in other racial or ethnic groups. About 5% of adults with diabetes have type 1 diabetes.1 Genes you inherit from your parents play an important role in the development of type 1 diabetes. However, where you live may also affect your risk. Type 1 diabetes develops more often in winter and in people who live in colder climates. Type 2 diabetes is more common in adults, especially in people who are overweight and have a family history of diabetes. About 95% of adults with diabetes have type 2 diabetes.1 Type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in children and teens as more of them become overweight and obese.5 Do women of color need to worry about diabetes? Yes. Certain racial and ethnic groups have a higher risk for type 2 diabetes. These groups include: How does diabetes affect women differently than men? Diabetes affects women and men in almost equal numbers. However, diabetes affects women differently than men. Compared with men with diabetes, women with diabetes have:9 Does diabetes raise my risk for other health problems? Yes. The longer you have type 2 diabetes, the higher your risk for developing serious medical problems from diabetes. Also, if you smoke and have diabetes, you are even more likely to develop serious medical problems from diabetes, compared with people who have diabetes and do not smoke.11 The extra glucose in the blood that leads to diabetes can damage your nerves and blood vessels. Nerve damage from diabetes can lead to pain or a permanent loss of feeling in your hands, feet, and other parts of your body.12 Blood vessel damage from diabetes can also lead to: Women with diabetes are also at higher risk for: What causes diabetes? Researchers do not know the exact causes of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Researchers do know that inheriting certain genes from your family can raise your risk for developing diabetes. Obesity is also a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Smoking can also cause type 2 diabetes. And the more you smoke the higher your risk for type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems if you already have diabetes.13 Weight loss can help control type 2 diabetes so that you are healthier. Quitting smoking can also help you control your blood sugar levels. Being a healthy weight and not smoking can help all women be healthier. But, obesity and smoking do not always cause diabetes. Some women who are overweight or obese or smoke never develop diabetes. Also, women who are a normal weight or only slightly overweight can develop diabetes if they have other risk factors, such as a family history of diabetes. What are the signs and symptoms of diabetes? Type 1 diabetes symptoms are usually more severe and may develop suddenly. Type 2 diabetes may not cause any signs or symptoms at first. Symptoms can develop slowly over time. You may not notice them right away. Common signs and symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes include: Do I need to be tested for diabetes? Maybe. You should be tested for diabetes if you are between 40 and 70 years old and are overweight or obese. Your doctor may recommend testing earlier than age 40 if you also have other risk factors for diabetes. Also, talk to your doctor about diabetes testing if you have signs or symptoms of diabetes. Your doctor will use a blood test to see if you have diabetes. If the testing shows that your blood sugar levels are high, you can begin making healthy changes to your eating habits and getting more physical activity to help prevent diabetes. What is prediabetes? Prediabetes means your blood sugar (glucose) level is higher than normal, but it is lower than the diabetes range. It also means you are at higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes and heart disease. As many as 27 million American women have prediabetes.14 If you have prediabetes, you can make healthy changes, such as doing some type of physical activity on most days, to lower your risk of getting diabetes and return to normal blood sugar levels. Losing 7% of your body weight (or 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds) can lower your risk for type 2 diabetes by more than half. If you have prediabetes, get your blood glucose checked every year by a doctor or nurse.15 How is diabetes treated? Diabetes treatment includes managing your blood sugar levels to control your symptoms. You can help control your blood sugar levels by eating healthy and getting regular physical activity. With type 1 diabetes, you also will need to take insulin through shots or an insulin pump. Insulin cannot be taken as a pill. Type 2 diabetes treatment also may include taking medicine to control your blood sugar. Over time, people with type 2 diabetes make less and less of their own insulin. This may mean that you will need to increase your medicines or start taking insulin shots to keep your diabetes in control. Learn more about controlling diabetes at the National Diabetes Education Program website. Is there anything I can do to prevent type 1 diabetes? Researchers do not know how to prevent type 1 diabetes. Researchers are still looking for ways to prevent type 1 diabetes in women and girls by studying their close relatives who have diabetes. Is there anything I can do to prevent type 2 diabetes? Yes. Many studies, including the large Diabetes Prevention Program study, have proven that you can prevent diabetes by losing weight. Weight loss through healthy eating and more physical activity improves the way your body uses insulin and glucose. Learn how to eat healthier and get more physical activity. Is it safe for women with diabetes to get pregnant? Yes. If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you can have a healthy pregnancy. If you have diabetes and you want to have a baby, you need to plan ahead, before you get pregnant. Talk to your doctor before you get pregnant. He or she can talk to you about steps you can take to keep your baby healthy. This may include a diabetes education program to help you better understand your diabetes and how to control it during pregnancy. Did we answer your question about diabetes?

                "document": " Peripheral neuropathy Overview Peripheral neuropathy, a result of damage to your peripheral nerves, often causes weakness, numbness and pain, usually in your hands and feet. It can also affect other areas of your body. Your peripheral nervous system sends information from your brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) to the rest of your body. Peripheral neuropathy can result from traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems, inherited causes and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes is diabetes mellitus. People with peripheral neuropathy generally describe the pain as stabbing, burning or tingling. In many cases, symptoms improve, especially if caused by a treatable condition. Medications can reduce the pain of peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms Every nerve in your peripheral system has a specific function, so symptoms depend on the type of nerves affected. Nerves are classified into: - Sensory nerves that receive sensation, such as temperature, pain, vibration or touch, from the skin - Motor nerves that control muscle movement - Autonomic nerves that control functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, digestion and bladder Signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy might include: - Gradual onset of numbness, prickling or tingling in your feet or hands, which can spread upward into your legs and arms - Sharp, jabbing, throbbing, freezing or burning pain - Extreme sensitivity to touch - Lack of coordination and falling - Muscle weakness or paralysis if motor nerves are affected If autonomic nerves are affected, signs and symptoms might include: - Heat intolerance and altered sweating - Bowel, bladder or digestive problems - Changes in blood pressure, causing dizziness or lightheadedness Peripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve (mononeuropathy), two or more nerves in different areas (multiple mononeuropathy) or many nerves (polyneuropathy). Carpal tunnel syndrome is an example of mononeuropathy. Most people with peripheral neuropathy have polyneuropathy. Seek medical care right away if you notice unusual tingling, weakness or pain in your hands or feet. Early diagnosis and treatment offer the best chance for controlling your symptoms and preventing further damage to your peripheral nerves. Causes Not a single disease, peripheral neuropathy is nerve damage caused by a number of conditions. Causes of neuropathies include: - Alcoholism. Poor dietary choices made by people with alcoholism can lead to vitamin deficiencies. - Autoimmune diseases. These include Sjogren's syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and necrotizing vasculitis. - Diabetes. More than half the people with diabetes develop some type of neuropathy. - Exposure to poisons. Toxic substances include heavy metals or chemicals. - Medications. Certain medications, especially those used to treat cancer (chemotherapy), can cause peripheral neuropathy. - Infections. These include certain viral or bacterial infections, including Lyme disease, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C, leprosy, diphtheria and HIV. - Inherited disorders. Disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are hereditary types of neuropathy. - Trauma or pressure on the nerve. Traumas, such as from motor vehicle accidents, falls or sports injuries, can sever or damage peripheral nerves. Nerve pressure can result from having a cast or using crutches or repeating a motion such as typing many times. - Tumors. Growths, cancerous (malignant) and noncancerous (benign), can develop on the nerves or press nerves. Also, polyneuropathy can arise as a result of some cancers related to the body's immune response. These are a form of paraneoplastic syndrome. - Vitamin deficiencies. B vitamins - including B-1, B-6 and B-12 - vitamin E and niacin are crucial to nerve health. - Bone marrow disorders. These include abnormal protein in the blood (monoclonal gammopathies), a form of bone cancer (osteosclerotic myeloma), lymphoma and amyloidosis. - Other diseases. These include kidney disease, liver disease, connective tissue disorders and an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). In a number of cases, no cause can be identified (idiopathic). Risk factors Peripheral neuropathy risk factors include: - Diabetes mellitus, especially if your sugar levels are poorly controlled - Alcohol abuse - Vitamin deficiencies, particularly B vitamins - Infections, such as Lyme disease, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C and HIV - Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, in which your immune system attacks your own tissues - Kidney, liver or thyroid disorders - Exposure to toxins - Repetitive motion, such as those performed for certain jobs - Family history of neuropathy Complications Complications of peripheral neuropathy can include: - Burns and skin trauma. You might not feel temperature changes or pain on parts of your body that are numb. - Infection. Your feet and other areas lacking sensation can become injured without your knowing. Check these areas regularly and treat minor injuries before they become infected, especially if you have diabetes mellitus. - Falls. Weakness and loss of sensation may be associated with lack of balance and falling. Diagnosis Peripheral neuropathy has many potential causes. Besides a physical exam, which may include blood tests, diagnosis usually requires: - A full medical history. Your doctor will review your medical history, including your symptoms, your lifestyle, exposure to toxins, drinking habits and a family history of nervous system (neurological) diseases. - Neurological examination. Your doctor might check your tendon reflexes, your muscle strength and tone, your ability to feel certain sensations, and your posture and coordination. Your doctor may order tests, including: - Blood tests. These can detect vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, abnormal immune function and other indications of conditions that can cause peripheral neuropathy. - Imaging tests. CT or MRI scans can look for herniated disks, tumors or other abnormalities. - Nerve function tests. Electromyography records electrical activity in your muscles to detect nerve damage. A probe sends electrical signals to a nerve, and an electrode placed along the nerve's pathway records the nerve's response to the signals (nerve conduction studies). - Other nerve function tests. These might include an autonomic reflex screen that records how the autonomic nerve fibers work, a sweat test, and sensory tests that record how you feel touch, vibration, cooling and heat. - Nerve biopsy. This involves removing a small portion of a nerve, usually a sensory nerve, to look for abnormalities. - Skin biopsy. Your doctor removes a small portion of skin to look for a reduction in nerve endings. Treatment Treatment goals are to manage the condition causing your neuropathy and to relieve symptoms. If your lab tests indicate no underlying condition, your doctor might recommend watchful waiting to see if your neuropathy improves. Medications Besides medications used to treat conditions associated with peripheral neuropathy, medications used to relieve peripheral neuropathy signs and symptoms include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can relieve mild symptoms. For more-severe symptoms, your doctor might prescribe painkillers. Medications containing opioids, such as tramadol (Conzip, Ultram) or oxycodone (Oxycontin, Roxicodone, others), can lead to dependence and addiction, so these drugs generally are prescribed only when other treatments fail. - Anti-seizure medications. Medications such as gabapentin (Gralise, Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica), developed to treat epilepsy, may relieve nerve pain. Side effects can include drowsiness and dizziness. - Topical treatments. Capsaicin cream, which contains a substance found in hot peppers, can cause modest improvements in peripheral neuropathy symptoms. You might have skin burning and irritation where you apply the cream, but this usually lessens over time. Some people, however, can't tolerate it. Lidocaine patches are another treatment you apply to your skin that might offer pain relief. Side effects can include drowsiness, dizziness and numbness at the site of the patch. - Antidepressants. Certain tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, doxepin and nortriptyline (Pamelor), have been found to help relieve pain by interfering with chemical processes in your brain and spinal cord that cause you to feel pain. The serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine (Cymbalta) and the extended-release antidepressant venlafaxine (Effexor XR) also might ease the pain of peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes. Side effects may include dry mouth, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, decreased appetite and constipation. Therapies Various therapies and procedures might help ease the signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Electrodes placed on the skin deliver a gentle electric current at varying frequencies. TENS should be applied for 30 minutes daily for about a month. - Plasma exchange and intravenous immune globulin. These procedures, which help suppress immune system activity, might benefit people with certain inflammatory conditions. Plasma exchange involves removing your blood, then removing antibodies and other proteins from the blood and returning the blood to your body. In immune globulin therapy, you receive high levels of proteins that work as antibodies (immunoglobulins). - Physical therapy. If you have muscle weakness, physical therapy can help improve your movements. You may also need hand or foot braces, a cane, a walker, or a wheelchair. - Surgery. If you have neuropathies caused by pressure on nerves, such as pressure from tumors, you might need surgery to reduce the pressure. Lifestyle and home remedies To help you manage peripheral neuropathy: - Take care of your feet, especially if you have diabetes. Check daily for blisters, cuts or calluses. Wear soft, loose cotton socks and padded shoes. You can use a semicircular hoop, which is available in medical supply stores, to keep bedcovers off hot or sensitive feet. - Exercise. Regular exercise, such as walking three times a week, can reduce neuropathy pain, improve muscle strength and help control blood sugar levels. Gentle routines such as yoga and tai chi might also help. - Quit smoking. Cigarette smoking can affect circulation, increasing the risk of foot problems and other neuropathy complications. - Eat healthy meals. Good nutrition is especially important to ensure that you get essential vitamins and minerals. Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein in your diet. - Avoid excessive alcohol. Alcohol can worsen peripheral neuropathy. - Monitor your blood glucose levels. If you have diabetes, this will help keep your blood glucose under control and might help improve your neuropathy. Alternative medicine Some people with peripheral neuropathy try complementary treatments for relief. Although researchers haven't studied these techniques as thoroughly as they have most medications, the following therapies have shown some promise: - Acupuncture. Inserting thin needles into various points on your body might reduce peripheral neuropathy symptoms. You might need multiple sessions before you notice improvement. Acupuncture is generally considered safe when performed by a certified practitioner using sterile needles. - Alpha-lipoic acid. This has been used as a treatment for peripheral neuropathy in Europe for years. Discuss using alpha-lipoic acid with your doctor because it can affect blood sugar levels. Other side effects can include stomach upset and skin rash. - Herbs. Certain herbs, such as evening primrose oil, might help reduce neuropathy pain in people with diabetes. Some herbs interact with medications, so discuss herbs you're considering with your doctor. - Amino acids. Amino acids, such as acetyl-L-carnitine, might benefit people who have undergone chemotherapy and people with diabetes. Side effects might include nausea and vomiting. ",

                "document": " Bipolar disorder Overview Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly. Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any. Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy). Bipolar disorder care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. - Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). - Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode. - Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years - or one year in children and teenagers - of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). - Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: - Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired - Increased activity, energy or agitation - Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) - Decreased need for sleep - Unusual talkativeness - Racing thoughts - Distractibility - Poor decision-making - for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: - Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability) - Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all - or almost all - activities - Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression) - Either insomnia or sleeping too much - Either restlessness or slowed behavior - Fatigue or loss of energy - Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt - Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness - Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings. When to see a doctor Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don't get the treatment they need. And if you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out - and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. When to get emergency help Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number - in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. Causes The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as: - Biological differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. - Genetics. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder. Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include: - Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder - Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event - Drug or alcohol abuse Complications Left untreated, bipolar disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as: - Problems related to drug and alcohol use - Suicide or suicide attempts - Legal or financial problems - Damaged relationships - Poor work or school performance Co-occurring conditions If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful. Examples include: - Anxiety disorders - Eating disorders - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - Alcohol or drug problems - Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity Diagnosis To determine if you have bipolar disorder, your evaluation may include: - Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and lab tests to identify any medical problems that could be causing your symptoms. - Psychiatric assessment. Your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist, who will talk to you about your thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may also fill out a psychological self-assessment or questionnaire. With your permission, family members or close friends may be asked to provide information about your symptoms. - Mood charting. You may be asked to keep a daily record of your moods, sleep patterns or other factors that could help with diagnosis and finding the right treatment. - Criteria for bipolar disorder. Your psychiatrist may compare your symptoms with the criteria for bipolar and related disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnosis in children Although diagnosis of children and teenagers with bipolar disorder includes the same criteria that are used for adults, symptoms in children and teens often have different patterns and may not fit neatly into the diagnostic categories. Also, children who have bipolar disorder are frequently also diagnosed with other mental health conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or behavior problems, which can make diagnosis more complicated. Referral to a child psychiatrist with experience in bipolar disorder is recommended. Treatment Treatment is best guided by a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions (psychiatrist) who is skilled in treating bipolar and related disorders. You may have a treatment team that also includes a psychologist, social worker and psychiatric nurse. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Depending on your needs, treatment may include: - Medications. Often, you'll need to start taking medications to balance your moods right away. - Continued treatment. Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment with medications, even during periods when you feel better. People who skip maintenance treatment are at high risk of a relapse of symptoms or having minor mood changes turn into full-blown mania or depression. - Day treatment programs. Your doctor may recommend a day treatment program. These programs provide the support and counseling you need while you get symptoms under control. - Substance abuse treatment. If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you'll also need substance abuse treatment. Otherwise, it can be very difficult to manage bipolar disorder. - Hospitalization. Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if you're behaving dangerously, you feel suicidal or you become detached from reality (psychotic). Getting psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe and stabilize your mood, whether you're having a manic or major depressive episode. The primary treatments for bipolar disorder include medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy) to control symptoms, and also may include education and support groups. Medications A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder. The types and doses of medications prescribed are based on your particular symptoms. Medications may include: - Mood stabilizers. You'll typically need mood-stabilizing medication to control manic or hypomanic episodes. Examples of mood stabilizers include lithium (Lithobid), valproic acid (Depakene), divalproex sodium (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Equetro, others) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). - Antipsychotics. If symptoms of depression or mania persist in spite of treatment with other medications, adding an antipsychotic drug such as olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda) or asenapine (Saphris) may help. Your doctor may prescribe some of these medications alone or along with a mood stabilizer. - Antidepressants. Your doctor may add an antidepressant to help manage depression. Because an antidepressant can sometimes trigger a manic episode, it's usually prescribed along with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. - Antidepressant-antipsychotic. The medication Symbyax combines the antidepressant fluoxetine and the antipsychotic olanzapine. It works as a depression treatment and a mood stabilizer. - Anti-anxiety medications. Benzodiazepines may help with anxiety and improve sleep, but are usually used on a short-term basis. Finding the right medication Finding the right medication or medications for you will likely take some trial and error. If one doesn't work well for you, there are several others to try. This process requires patience, as some medications need weeks to months to take full effect. Generally only one medication is changed at a time so that your doctor can identify which medications work to relieve your symptoms with the least bothersome side effects. Medications also may need to be adjusted as your symptoms change. Side effects Mild side effects often improve as you find the right medications and doses that work for you, and your body adjusts to the medications. Talk to your doctor or mental health professional if you have bothersome side effects. Don't make changes or stop taking your medications. If you stop your medication, you may experience withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return. You may become very depressed, feel suicidal, or go into a manic or hypomanic episode. If you think you need to make a change, call your doctor. Medications and pregnancy A number of medications for bipolar disorder can be associated with birth defects and can pass through breast milk to your baby. Certain medications, such as valproic acid and divalproex sodium, should not be used during pregnancy. Also, birth control medications may lose effectiveness when taken along with certain bipolar disorder medications. Discuss treatment options with your doctor before you become pregnant, if possible. If you're taking medication to treat your bipolar disorder and think you may be pregnant, talk to your doctor right away. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy is a vital part of bipolar disorder treatment and can be provided in individual, family or group settings. Several types of therapy may be helpful. These include: - Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT). IPSRT focuses on the stabilization of daily rhythms, such as sleeping, waking and mealtimes. A consistent routine allows for better mood management. People with bipolar disorder may benefit from establishing a daily routine for sleep, diet and exercise. - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The focus is identifying unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replacing them with healthy, positive ones. CBT can help identify what triggers your bipolar episodes. You also learn effective strategies to manage stress and to cope with upsetting situations. - Psychoeducation. Learning about bipolar disorder (psychoeducation) can help you and your loved ones understand the condition. Knowing what's going on can help you get the best support, identify issues, make a plan to prevent relapse and stick with treatment. - Family-focused therapy. Family support and communication can help you stick with your treatment plan and help you and your loved ones recognize and manage warning signs of mood swings. Other treatment options Depending on your needs, other treatments may be added to your depression therapy. During electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), electrical currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can reverse symptoms of certain mental illnesses. ECT may be an option for bipolar treatment if you don't get better with medications, can't take antidepressants for health reasons such as pregnancy or are at high risk of suicide. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being investigated as an option for those who haven't responded to antidepressants. Treatment in children and teenagers Treatments for children and teenagers are generally decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on symptoms, medication side effects and other factors. Generally, treatment includes: - Medications. Children and teens with bipolar disorder are often prescribed the same types of medications as those used in adults. There's less research on the safety and effectiveness of bipolar medications in children than in adults, so treatment decisions are often based on adult research. - Psychotherapy. Initial and long-term therapy can help keep symptoms from returning. Psychotherapy can help children and teens manage their routines, develop coping skills, address learning difficulties, resolve social problems, and help strengthen family bonds and communication. And, if needed, it can help treat substance abuse problems common in older children and teens with bipolar disorder. - Psychoeducation. Psychoeducation can include learning the symptoms of bipolar disorder and how they differ from behavior related to your child's developmental age, the situation and appropriate cultural behavior. Understanding about bipolar disorder can also help you support your child. - Support. Working with teachers and school counselors and encouraging support from family and friends can help identify services and encourage success. Lifestyle and home remedies You'll probably need to make lifestyle changes to stop cycles of behavior that worsen your bipolar disorder. Here are some steps to take: - Quit drinking or using recreational drugs. One of the biggest concerns with bipolar disorder is the negative consequences of risk-taking behavior and drug or alcohol abuse. Get help if you have trouble quitting on your own. - Form healthy relationships. Surround yourself with people who are a positive influence. Friends and family members can provide support and help you watch for warning signs of mood shifts. - Create a healthy routine. Having a regular routine for sleeping, eating and physical activity can help balance your moods. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program. Eat a healthy diet. If you take lithium, talk with your doctor about appropriate fluid and salt intake. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor or mental health professional about what you can do. - Check first before taking other medications. Call the doctor who's treating you for bipolar disorder before you take medications prescribed by another doctor or any over-the-counter supplements or medications. Sometimes other medications trigger episodes of depression or mania or may interfere with medications you're taking for bipolar disorder. - Consider keeping a mood chart. Keeping a record of your daily moods, treatments, sleep, activities and feelings may help identify triggers, effective treatment options and when treatment needs to be adjusted. Alternative medicine There isn't much research on alternative or complementary medicine - sometimes called integrative medicine - and bipolar disorder. Most of the studies are on major depression, so it isn't clear how these nontraditional approaches work for bipolar disorder. If you choose to use alternative or complementary medicine in addition to your physician-recommended treatment, take some precautions first: - Don't stop taking your prescribed medications or skip therapy sessions. Alternative or complementary medicine is not a substitute for regular medical care when it comes to treating bipolar disorder. - Be honest with your doctors and mental health professionals. Tell them exactly which alternative or complementary treatments you use or would like to try. - Be aware of potential dangers. Alternative and complementary products aren't regulated the way prescription drugs are. Just because it's natural doesn't mean it's safe. Before using alternative or complementary medicine, talk to your doctor about the risks, including possible serious interactions with medications. ",

                "document": " Klinefelter syndrome Overview Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that results when a boy is born with an extra copy of the X chromosome. Klinefelter syndrome is a common genetic condition affecting males, and it often isn't diagnosed until adulthood. Klinefelter syndrome may adversely affect testicular growth, resulting in smaller than normal testicles, which can lead to lower production of testosterone. The syndrome may also cause reduced muscle mass, reduced body and facial hair, and enlarged breast tissue. The effects of Klinefelter syndrome vary, and not everyone has the same signs and symptoms. Most men with Klinefelter syndrome produce little or no sperm, but assisted reproductive procedures may make it possible for some men with Klinefelter syndrome to father children. Symptoms Signs and symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome vary widely among males with the disorder. Many boys with Klinefelter syndrome have few noticeable signs, and the condition may go undiagnosed until adulthood. For others, the condition has a noticeable effect on growth or appearance. Signs and symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome also vary by age. Signs and symptoms may include: - Weak muscles - Slow motor development - taking longer than average to sit up, crawl and walk - Delay in speaking - Quiet, docile personality - Problems at birth, such as testicles that haven't descended into the scrotum Signs and symptoms may include: - Taller than average stature - Longer legs, shorter torso and broader hips compared with other boys - Absent, delayed or incomplete puberty - After puberty, less muscle and less facial and body hair compared with other teens - Small, firm testicles - Small penis - Enlarged breast tissue (gynecomastia) - Weak bones - Low energy levels - Tendency to be shy and sensitive - Difficulty expressing thoughts and feelings or socializing - Problems with reading, writing, spelling or math - Low sperm count or no sperm - Small testicles and penis - Low sex drive - Taller than average height - Weak bones - Decreased facial and body hair - Less muscular than normal - Enlarged breast tissue - Increased belly fat See a doctor if you or your son has: - Slow development during infancy or boyhood. Delays in growth and development can be the first sign of a number of conditions that need treatment - including Klinefelter syndrome. Though some variation in physical and mental development is normal, it's best to check with a doctor if you have any concerns. - Male infertility. Many men with Klinefelter syndrome aren't diagnosed with infertility until they realize they're unable to father a child. Causes Klinefelter syndrome occurs as a result of a random error that causes a male to be born with an extra sex chromosome. It isn't an inherited condition. Humans have 46 chromosomes, including two sex chromosomes that determine a person's sex. Females have two X sex chromosomes (XX). Males have an X and a Y sex chromosome (XY). Klinefelter syndrome can be caused by: - One extra copy of the X chromosome in each cell (XXY), the most common cause - An extra X chromosome in some of the cells (mosaic Klinefelter syndrome), with fewer symptoms - More than one extra copy of the X chromosome, which is rare and results in a severe form Extra copies of genes on the X chromosome can interfere with male sexual development and fertility. Risk factors Klinefelter syndrome stems from a random genetic event. The risk of Klinefelter syndrome isn't increased by anything a parent does or doesn't do. For older mothers, the risk is higher but only slightly. Diagnosis Your doctor will likely do a thorough physical exam and ask detailed questions about symptoms and health. This may include examining the genital area and chest, performing tests to check reflexes, and assessing development and functioning. The main tests used to diagnose Klinefelter syndrome are: - Hormone testing. Blood or urine samples can reveal abnormal hormone levels that are a sign of Klinefelter syndrome. - Chromosome analysis. Also called karyotype analysis, this test is used to confirm a diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome. A blood sample is sent to the lab to check the shape and number of chromosomes. A small percentage of males with Klinefelter syndrome are diagnosed before birth. This might be identified after a pregnant woman has a procedure to examine fetal cells drawn from the amniotic fluid (amniocentesis) or placenta for another reason, such as being older than age 35 or having a family history of genetic conditions. Treatment If you or your son is diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, your health care team may include a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders involving the body's glands and hormones (endocrinologist), a speech therapist, a pediatrician, a physical therapist, a genetic counselor, a reproductive medicine or infertility specialist, and a counselor or psychologist. Although there's no way to repair the sex chromosome changes due to Klinefelter syndrome, treatments can help minimize its effects. The earlier a diagnosis is made and treatment is started, the greater the benefits. But it's never too late to get help. Treatment for Klinefelter syndrome may include: - Testosterone replacement therapy. Starting at the time of the usual onset of puberty, testosterone replacement can be given to help stimulate changes that normally occur at puberty, such as developing a deeper voice, growing facial and body hair, and increasing muscle mass and penis size. Testosterone therapy can also improve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. It will not result in testicle enlargement or improve infertility. - Breast tissue removal. In males who develop enlarged breasts, excess breast tissue can be removed by a plastic surgeon, leaving a more normal-looking chest. - Speech and physical therapy. These treatments can help boys with Klinefelter syndrome overcome problems with speech, language and muscle weakness. - Educational evaluation and support. Some boys with Klinefelter syndrome have trouble learning and socializing and can benefit from extra assistance. Talk to your child's teacher, school counselor or school nurse about what kind of support might help. - Fertility treatment. Most men with Klinefelter syndrome are unable to father children because few or no sperm are produced in the testicles. For some men with minimal sperm production, a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may help. During ICSI, sperm is removed from the testicle with a biopsy needle and injected directly into the egg. - Psychological counseling. Having Klinefelter syndrome can be a challenge, especially during puberty and young adulthood. For men with the condition, coping with infertility can be difficult. A family therapist, counselor or psychologist can help work through the emotional issues. ",

It makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal. Causes The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale. Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by: Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis Birth defects of the heart Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism) Heart failure Heart valve disease HIV infection Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic) Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis or any other severe chronic lung condition Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs) Obstructive sleep apnea In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known. IPAH affects more women than men. If pulmonary hypertension is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension. Symptoms Shortness of breath or lightheadedness during activity is often the first symptom. Fast heart rate (palpitations) may be present. Over time, symptoms occur with lighter activity or even while at rest. Other symptoms include: Ankle and leg swelling Bluish color of the lips or skin (cyanosis) Chest pain or pressure, usually in the front of the chest Dizziness or fainting spells Fatigue Increased abdomen size Weakness People with pulmonary hypertension often have symptoms that come and go. They report good days and bad days. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. The exam may find: Abnormal heart sounds Feeling of a pulse over the breastbone Heart murmur on the right side of the heart Larger-than-normal veins in the neck Leg swelling Liver and spleen swelling Normal breath sounds if pulmonary hypertension is idiopathic or due to congenital heart disease Abnormal breath sounds if pulmonary hypertension is from other lung disease In the early stages of the disease, the exam may be normal or almost normal. The condition may take several months to diagnose. Asthma and other diseases may cause similar symptoms and must be ruled out. Tests that may be ordered include: Blood tests Cardiac catheterization Chest x-ray CT scan of the chest Echocardiogram ECG Lung function tests Nuclear lung scan Pulmonary arteriogram 6-minute walk test Sleep study Tests to check for autoimmune problems Treatment There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms and prevent more lung damage. It is important to treat medical disorders that cause pulmonary hypertension, such as obstructive sleep apnea, lung conditions, and heart valve problems. Many treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension are available. If you are prescribed medicines, they may be taken by mouth (oral), received through the vein (intravenous, or IV), or breathed in (inhaled). Your provider will decide which medicine is best for you. You will be closely monitored during treatment to watch for side effects and to see how well you are responding to the medicine. DO NOT stop taking your medicines without talking to your provider. Other treatments may include: Blood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots, especially if you have IPAH Oxygen therapy at home Lung, or in some cases, heart-lung transplant, if medicines do not work Other important tips to follow: Avoid pregnancy Avoid heavy physical activities and lifting Avoid traveling to high altitudes Get a yearly flu vaccine, as well as other vaccines such as the pneumonia vaccine Stop smoking Outlook (Prognosis) How well you do depends on what caused the condition. Medicines for IPAH may help slow the disease. As the illness gets worse, you will need to make changes in your home to help you get around the house. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if: You begin to develop shortness of breath when you are active Shortness of breath gets worse You develop chest pain You develop other symptoms Review Date 2/18/2018 Updated by: Denis Hadjiliadis, MD, MHS, Paul F.

Symptoms of AVED include slurred speech ( dysarthria ), difficulty coordinating movements ( ataxia), numbness in the hands and feet ( peripheral neuropathy ), and progressive leg weakness. Some affected individuals may experience vision loss due to damage to the back of the eye ( retinitis pigmentosa). Symptoms typically begin during childhood or adolescence and worsen with age, resulting in the need for a wheelchair by early adulthood. AVED is caused by a mutation to the TTPA gene . When this gene is damaged, vitamin E cannot be distributed throughout the body. Vitamin E is important because it protects the cells of the neurological system (neurons) from dangerous molecules called free radicals. AVED is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment for AVED includes vitamin E supplements, which will prevent AVED from developing if given before symptoms begin and may reverse some neurological symptoms if begun after AVED develops.

Other studies that may be useful include: nerve conduction studies, brain imaging , and studies of nerve tissues . [2] [3] Although no universal diagnostic guidelines are available, researchers suggest that diseases that cause fat malabsorption, such as abetalipoproteinemia should be ruled out. Genetic testing finding two TTPA gene mutations may be useful to confirm the diagnosis. [2] [3] Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Treatment Treatment for AVED requires lifelong high dose supplementation of vitamin E. When treated early, some symptoms, such as ataxia and intellectual decline, can be reversed. In older patients, treatment may slow disease progression, but some symptoms remain. [2] [3] Research indicates that if vitamin E treatment is initiated in presymptomatic individuals with two mutations in the TTPA gene (e.g., younger sibs of an affected individual), the symptoms of AVED will not develop. [2] Find a Specialist If you need medical advice, you can look for doctors or other healthcare professionals who have experience with this disease. You may find these specialists through advocacy organizations, clinical trials, or articles published in medical journals. You may also want to contact a university or tertiary medical center in your area, because these centers tend to see more complex cases and have the latest technology and treatments. If you can't find a specialist in your local area, try contacting national or international specialists. They may be able to refer you to someone they know through conferences or research efforts. Some specialists may be willing to consult with you or your local doctors over the phone or by email if you can't travel to them for care. You can find more tips in our guide, How to Find a Disease Specialist. We also encourage you to explore the rest of this page to find resources that can help you find specialists. Healthcare Resources To find a medical professional who specializes in genetics, you can ask your doctor for a referral or you can search for one yourself. Online directories are provided by the American College of Medical Genetics and the National Society of Genetic Counselors. If you need additional help, contact a GARD Information Specialist.

People with celiac disease cannot eat gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The disease can cause long-term digestive problems and keep you from getting nutrients you need. What is celiac disease? Celiac disease is a digestive disorder that damages the small intestine. The disease is triggered by eating foods containing gluten. Gluten is a protein found naturally in wheat, barley, and rye, and is common in foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, and cakes. Many pre-packaged foods, lip balms and lipsticks, hair and skin products, toothpastes, vitamin and nutrient supplements, and, rarely, medicines, contain gluten.Celiac disease can be very serious. The disease can cause long-lasting digestive problems and keep your body from getting all the nutrients it needs. Celiac disease can also affect the body outside the intestine.Celiac disease is different from gluten sensitivity or wheat intolerance. If you have gluten sensitivity, you may have symptoms similar to those of celiac disease, such as abdominal pain and tiredness. Unlike celiac disease, gluten sensitivity does not damage the small intestine.Celiac disease is also different from a wheat allergy. In both cases, your body's immune system reacts to wheat. However, some symptoms in wheat allergies, such as having itchy eyes or a hard time breathing, are different from celiac disease. Wheat allergies also do not cause long-term damage to the small intestine.1 How common is celiac disease? As many as one in 141 Americans has celiac disease, although most don't know it.2 Who is more likely to develop celiac disease? Although celiac disease affects children and adults in all parts of the world, the disease is more common in Caucasians and more often diagnosed in females. You are more likely to develop celiac disease if someone in your family has the disease. Celiac disease also is more common among people with certain other diseases, such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and type 1 diabetes. What other health problems do people with celiac disease have? If you have celiac disease, you also may be at risk forAddison's disease Hashimoto's disease primary biliary cirrhosis type 1 diabetes What are the complications of celiac disease? Long-term complications of celiac disease includemalnutrition, a condition in which you don't get enough vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients you need to be healthy accelerated osteoporosis or bone softening, known as osteomalacia nervous system problems problems related to reproductionRare complications can includeintestinal cancer liver diseases lymphoma, a cancer of part of the immune system called the lymph system that includes the gutIn rare cases, you may continue to have trouble absorbing nutrients even though you have been following a strict gluten-free diet. If you have this condition, called refractory celiac disease, your intestines are severely damaged and can't heal. You may need to receive nutrients through an IV. Definition & Facts Symptoms and Causes If you have celiac disease, you may experience digestive symptoms or symptoms in other parts of your body. Digestive symptoms are more common in children than adults. Some people with celiac disease have no symptoms. What are the symptoms of celiac disease? Most people with celiac disease have one or more symptoms. However, some people with the disease may not have symptoms or feel sick. Sometimes health issues such as surgery, a pregnancy, childbirth, bacterial gastroenteritis, a viral infection, or severe mental stress can trigger celiac disease symptoms.If you have celiac disease, you may have digestive problems or other symptoms. Digestive symptoms are more common in children and can includebloating, or a feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen chronic diarrhea constipation gas nausea pale, foul-smelling, or fatty stools that float stomach pain vomitingFor children with celiac disease, being unable to absorb nutrients when they are so important to normal growth and development can lead todamage to the permanent teeth's enamel delayed puberty failure to thrive in infants mood changes or feeling annoyed or impatient slowed growth and short height weight lossAdults are less likely to have digestive symptoms and, instead, may have one or more of the following:anemia a red, smooth, shiny tongue bone or joint pain depression or anxiety dermatitis herpetiformis headaches infertility or repeated miscarriage missed menstrual periods mouth problems such a canker sores or dry mouth seizures tingling numbness in the hands and feet tiredness weak and brittle bonesAdults who have digestive symptoms with celiac disease may haveabdominal pain and bloating intestinal blockages tiredness that lasts for long periods of time ulcers, or sores on the stomach or lining of the intestineCeliac disease also can produce a reaction in which your immune system, or your body's natural defense system, attacks healthy cells in your body. This reaction can spread outside your digestive tract to other areas of your body, including yourbones joints nervous system skin spleenDepending on how old you are when a doctor diagnoses your celiac disease, some symptoms, such as short height and tooth defects, will not improve.Dermatitis herpetiformis is an itchy, blistering skin rash that usually appears on the elbows, knees, buttocks, back, or scalp. The rash affects about 10 percent of people with celiac disease. The rash can affect people of all ages but is most likely to appear for the first time between the ages of 30 and 40. Men who have the rash also may have oral or, rarely, genital sores. Some people with celiac disease may have the rash and no other symptoms. Why are celiac disease symptoms so varied? Symptoms of celiac disease vary from person to person. Your symptoms may depend onhow long you were breastfed as an infant; some studies have shown that the longer you were breastfed, the later celiac disease symptoms appear how much gluten you eat how old you were when you started eating gluten the amount of damage to your small intestine your age-symptoms can vary between young children and adultsPeople with celiac disease who have no symptoms can still develop complications from the disease over time if they do not get treatment. What causes celiac disease? Research suggests that celiac disease only happens to individuals who have particular genes. These genes are common and are carried by about one-third of the population. Individuals also have to be eating food that contains gluten to get celiac disease. Researchers do not know exactly what triggers celiac disease in people at risk who eat gluten over a long period of time. Sometimes the disease runs in families. About 10 to 20 percent of close relatives of people with celiac disease also are affected.3Your chances of developing celiac disease increase when you have changes in your genes, or variants. Certain gene variants and other factors, such as things in your environment, can lead to celiac disease. Symptoms & Causes Diagnosis Your doctor may diagnose celiac disease with a medical and family history, a physical exam, blood tests, an intestinal biopsy, a skin biopsy, and genetic tests. Doctors in the United Stated do not routinely screen people for celiac disease. How do doctors diagnose celiac disease? Celiac disease can be hard to diagnose because some of the symptoms are like symptoms of other diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and lactose intolerance. Your doctor may diagnose celiac disease with a medical and family history, physical exam, and tests. Tests may include blood tests, genetic tests, and biopsy.Your doctor will ask you for information about your family's health-specifically, if anyone in your family has a history of celiac disease.During a physical exam, a doctor most oftenchecks your body for a rash or malnutrition, a condition that arises when you don't get enough vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients you need to be healthy listens to sounds in your abdomen using a stethoscope taps on your abdomen to check for pain and fullness or swellingFor some people, a dental visit can be the first step toward discovering celiac disease. Dental enamel defects, such as white, yellow, or brown spots on the teeth, are a pretty common problem in people with celiac disease, especially children. These defects can help dentists and other health care professionals identify celiac disease. What tests do doctors use to diagnose celiac disease? A health care professional may take a blood sample from you and send the sample to a lab to test for antibodies common in celiac disease. If blood test results are negative and your doctor still suspects celiac disease, he or she may order more blood tests.If a biopsy and other blood tests do not clearly confirm celiac disease, your doctor may order genetic blood tests to check for certain gene changes, or variants.4 You are very unlikely to have celiac disease if these gene variants are not present. Having these variants alone is not enough to diagnose celiac disease because they also are common in people without the disease. In fact, most people with these genes will never get celiac disease.If blood tests suggest you have celiac disease, your doctor will perform a biopsy to be sure. During a biopsy, the doctor takes a small piece of tissue from your small intestine during a procedure called an upper GI endoscopy.If a doctor suspects you have dermatitis herpetiformis, he or she will perform a skin biopsy. For a skin biopsy, the doctor removes tiny pieces of skin tissue to examine with a microscope.A doctor examines the skin tissue and checks the tissue for antibodies common in celiac disease. If the skin tissue has the antibodies, a doctor will perform blood tests to confirm celiac disease. If the skin biopsy and blood tests both suggest celiac disease, you may not need an intestinal biopsy. Do doctors screen for celiac disease? Screening is testing for diseases when you have no symptoms. Doctors in the United States do not routinely screen people for celiac disease. However, blood relatives of people with celiac disease and those with type 1 diabetes should talk with their doctor about their chances of getting the disease.Many researchers recommend routine screening of all family members, such as parents and siblings, for celiac disease.5 However, routine genetic screening for celiac disease is not usually helpful when diagnosing the disease. Diagnosis Treatment Doctors treat celiac disease by prescribing a gluten-free diet. Symptoms significantly improve for most people with celiac disease who follow a gluten-free diet. A dietitian can teach you how to avoid gluten while following a healthy and nutritious diet. How do doctors treat celiac disease? Doctors treat celiac disease with a gluten-free diet. Gluten is a protein found naturally in wheat, barley, and rye that triggers a reaction if you have celiac disease. Symptoms greatly improve for most people with celiac disease who stick to a gluten-free diet. In recent years, grocery stores and restaurants have added many more gluten-free foods and products, making it easier to stay gluten free.Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian who specializes in treating people with celiac disease. The dietitian will teach you how to avoid gluten while following a healthy diet. He or she will help youcheck food and product labels for gluten design everyday meal plans make healthy choices about the types of foods to eatFor most people, following a gluten-free diet will heal damage in the small intestine and prevent more damage. You may see symptoms improve within days to weeks of starting the diet. The small intestine usually heals in 3 to 6 months in children. Complete healing can take several years in adults. Once the intestine heals, the villi, which were damaged by the disease, regrow and will absorb nutrients from food into the bloodstream normally.If you have dermatitis herpetiformis-an itchy, blistering skin rash-skin symptoms generally respond to a gluten-free diet. However, skin symptoms may return if you add gluten back into your diet. Medicines such as dapsone, taken by mouth, can control the skin symptoms. People who take dapsone need to have regular blood tests to check for side effects from the medicine.Dapsone does not treat intestinal symptoms or damage, which is why you should stay on a gluten-free diet if you have the rash. Even when you follow a gluten-free diet, the rash may take months or even years to fully heal-and often comes back over the years. Avoiding medicines and nonfood products that may contain gluten In addition to prescribing a gluten-free diet, your doctor will want you to avoid all hidden sources of gluten. If you have celiac disease, ask a pharmacist about ingredients inherbal and nutritional supplements prescription and over-the-counter medicines vitamin and mineral supplementsYou also could take in or transfer from your hands to your mouth other products that contain gluten without knowing it. Products that may contain gluten includechildren's modeling dough, such as Play-Doh cosmetics lipstick, lip gloss, and lip balm skin and hair products toothpaste and mouthwash communion wafersMedications are rare sources of gluten. Even if gluten is present in a medicine, it is likely to be in such small quantities that it would not cause any symptoms.Reading product labels can sometimes help you avoid gluten. Some product makers label their products as being gluten-free. If a product label doesn't list the product's ingredients, ask the maker of the product for an ingredients list. Treatment If you don't improve after starting a gluten-free diet, you may still be eating or using small amounts of gluten. You probably will start responding to the gluten-free diet once you find and cut out all hidden sources of gluten. Hidden sources of gluten include additives made with wheat, such asmodified food starch malt flavoring preservatives stabilizersIf you still have symptoms even after changing your diet, you may have other conditions or disorders that are more common with celiac disease, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), lactose intolerance, microscopic colitis, dysfunction of the pancreas, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Eating, Diet, and Nutrition Eating, diet, and nutrition play a major role in treating celiac disease. You should maintain a gluten-free diet by avoiding all products that contain gluten. You can maintain a well-balanced diet with a variety of foods that do not include gluten. What should I avoid eating if I have celiac disease? Avoiding foods with gluten, a protein found naturally in wheat, rye, and barley, is critical in treating celiac disease. Removing gluten from your diet will improve symptoms, heal damage to your small intestine, and prevent further damage over time. While you may need to avoid certain foods, the good news is that many healthy, gluten-free foods and products are available.You should avoid all products that contain gluten, such as most cereal, grains, and pasta, and many processed foods. Be sure to always read food ingredient lists carefully to make sure the food you want to eat doesn't have gluten. In addition, discuss gluten-free food choices with a dietitian or health care professional who specializes in celiac disease. What should I eat if I have celiac disease? Foods such as meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, rice, and potatoes without additives or seasonings do not contain gluten and are part of a well-balanced diet. You can eat gluten-free types of bread, pasta, and other foods that are now easier to find in stores, restaurants, and at special food companies. You also can eat potato, rice, soy, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, or bean flour instead of wheat flour.In the past, doctors and dietitians advised against eating oats if you have celiac disease. Evidence suggests that most people with the disease can safely eat moderate amounts of oats, as long as they did not come in contact with wheat gluten during processing. You should talk with your health care team about whether to include oats in your diet.When shopping and eating out, remember toread food labels-especially on canned, frozen, and processed foods-for ingredients that contain gluten identify foods labelled \"gluten-free;\" by law, these foods must contain less than 20 parts per million, well below the threshold to cause problems in the great majority of patients with celiac disease ask restaurant servers and chefs about how they prepare the food and what is in it find out whether a gluten-free menu is available ask a dinner or party host about gluten-free options before attending a social gatheringFoods labeled gluten-free tend to cost more than the same foods that have gluten. You may find that naturally gluten-free foods are less expensive. With practice, looking for gluten can become second nature.If you have just been diagnosed with celiac disease, you and your family members may find support groups helpful as you adjust to a new approach to eating. Is a gluten-free diet safe if I don't have celiac disease? In recent years, more people without celiac disease have adopted a gluten-free diet, believing that avoiding gluten is healthier or could help them lose weight. No current data suggests that the general public should maintain a gluten-free diet for weight loss or better health. 6, 7A gluten-free diet isn't always a healthy diet. For instance, a gluten-free diet may not provide enough of the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals the body needs, such as fiber, iron, and calcium. Some gluten-free products can be high in calories and sugar.If you think you might have celiac disease, don't start avoiding gluten without first speaking with your doctor. If your doctor diagnoses you with celiac disease, he or she will put you on a gluten-free diet. Gluten-free food labeling requirements The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a rule defining what \"gluten-free\" means on food labels. The \"gluten-free\" for food labeling rule requires that any food with the terms \"gluten-free,\" \"no gluten,\" \"free of gluten,\" and \"without gluten\" on the label must meet all of the definition's requirements.While the FDA rule does not apply to foods regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including meat and egg products, it is often still observed.

                "document": " Fibromyalgia Overview Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals. Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event. Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression. While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help. Symptoms Symptoms of fibromyalgia include: - Widespread pain. The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months. To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist. - Fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea. - Cognitive difficulties. A symptom commonly referred to as \"fibro fog\" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks. Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other painful conditions, such as: - Irritable bowel syndrome - Migraine and other types of headaches - Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome - Temporomandibular joint disorders Causes Doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together. These may include: - Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder. - Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia. - Physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident. Psychological stress may also trigger the condition. Why does it hurt? Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals. Risk factors Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: - Your sex. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men. - Family history. You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition. - Other disorders. If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia. Diagnosis In the past, doctors would check 18 specific points on a person's body to see how many of them were painful when pressed firmly. Newer guidelines don't require a tender point exam. Instead, a fibromyalgia diagnosis can be made if a person has had widespread pain for more than three months - with no underlying medical condition that could cause the pain. Blood tests While there is no lab test to confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, your doctor may want to rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. Blood tests may include: - Complete blood count - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Cyclic citrullinated peptide test - Rheumatoid factor - Thyroid function tests Treatment In general, treatments for fibromyalgia include both medication and self-care. The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health. No one treatment works for all symptoms. Medications Medications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep. Common choices include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpful. Your doctor might suggest a prescription pain reliever such as tramadol (Ultram). Narcotics are not advised, because they can lead to dependence and may even worsen the pain over time. - Antidepressants. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) may help ease the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline or the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine to help promote sleep. - Anti-seizure drugs. Medications designed to treat epilepsy are often useful in reducing certain types of pain. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is sometimes helpful in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms, while pregabalin (Lyrica) was the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat fibromyalgia. Therapy A variety of different therapies can help reduce the effect that fibromyalgia has on your body and your life. Examples include: - Physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can help you make adjustments to your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. - Counseling. Talking with a counselor can help strengthen your belief in your abilities and teach you strategies for dealing with stressful situations. Lifestyle and home remedies Self-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia. - Reduce stress. Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress. Allow yourself time each day to relax. That may mean learning how to say no without guilt. But try not to change your routine completely. People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than do those who remain active. Try stress management techniques, such as deep-breathing exercises or meditation. - Get enough sleep. Because fatigue is one of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia, getting sufficient sleep is essential. In addition to allotting enough time for sleep, practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and limiting daytime napping. - Exercise regularly. At first, exercise may increase your pain. But doing it gradually and regularly often decreases symptoms. Appropriate exercises may include walking, swimming, biking and water aerobics. A physical therapist can help you develop a home exercise program. Stretching, good posture and relaxation exercises also are helpful. - Pace yourself. Keep your activity on an even level. If you do too much on your good days, you may have more bad days. Moderation means not overdoing it on your good days, but likewise it means not self-limiting or doing too little on the days when symptoms flare. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy foods. Limit your caffeine intake. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day. Alternative medicine Complementary and alternative therapies for pain and stress management aren't new. Some, such as meditation and yoga, have been practiced for thousands of years. But their use has become more popular in recent years, especially with people who have chronic illnesses, such as fibromyalgia. Several of these treatments do appear to safely relieve stress and reduce pain, and some are gaining acceptance in mainstream medicine. But many practices remain unproved because they haven't been adequately studied. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical system based on restoring normal balance of life forces by inserting very fine needles through the skin to various depths. According to Western theories of acupuncture, the needles cause changes in blood flow and levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord. Some studies indicate that acupuncture helps relieve fibromyalgia symptoms, while others show no benefit. - Massage therapy. This is one of the oldest methods of health care still in practice. It involves use of different manipulative techniques to move your body's muscles and soft tissues. Massage can reduce your heart rate, relax your muscles, improve range of motion in your joints and increase production of your body's natural painkillers. It often helps relieve stress and anxiety. - Yoga and tai chi. These practices combine meditation, slow movements, deep breathing and relaxation. Both have been found to be helpful in controlling fibromyalgia symptoms. ",

                "document": " Diverticulitis Summary Diverticula are small, bulging sacs or pouches that form on the inner wall of the intestine. Diverticulitis occurs when these pouches become inflamed or infected. Most often, these pouches are in the large intestine (colon). Causes The formation of pouches or sacs on the intestinal lining is called diverticulosis. It is found in more than half of Americans over age 60. However, no one knows exactly what causes the pouches to form. Eating a low-fiber diet mostly made up of processed foods may be a cause. Constipation and hard stools are more likely when you do not eat enough fiber. Straining to pass stools increases the pressure in the colon or intestines, which may lead to the formation of these pouches. In some cases, one of the pouches can become inflamed and a small tear develops in the lining of the intestine. This can lead to an infection at the site. When this occurs, the condition is called diverticulitis. The cause of diverticulitis is not known. Symptoms People with diverticulosis often have no symptoms, but they may have bloating and cramping in the lower part of the belly. Rarely, they may notice blood in their stool or on toilet paper. Symptoms of diverticulitis are more severe and often start suddenly, but they may become worse over a few days. They include: Tenderness, usually in the left lower side of the abdomen Bloating or gas Fever and chills Nausea and vomiting Not feeling hungry and not eating Exams and Tests Your health care provider will examine you. You may need blood tests to see if you have an infection. Other tests that help diagnose diverticulitis may include: CT scan Ultrasound of the abdomen X-rays of the abdomen Treatment The treatment of diverticulitis depends on how serious the symptoms are. Some people may need to be in the hospital, but most of the time, the problem can be treated at home. To help with the pain, your provider may suggest that you: Rest in bed and use a heating pad on your belly. Take pain medicines (ask your provider which ones you should use). Drink only fluids for a day or two, and then slowly begin drinking thicker liquids and then eating foods. The provider may treat you with antibiotics. After you are better, your provider will suggest that you add more fiber to your diet. Eating more fiber can help prevent future attacks. If you have bloating or gas, reduce the amount of fiber you eat for a few days. Once these pouches have formed, you will have them for life. Diverticulitis can return, but some providers think a high-fiber diet may lessen your chances of a recurrence. Outlook (Prognosis) Most often, this is a mild condition that responds well to treatment. Some people will have more than one attack of diverticulitis. Surgery may be needed in some cases. Many times, providers will recommend that you have a colonoscopy after diverticulitis has healed. Possible Complications More serious problems that may develop are: Abnormal connections that form between parts of the colon or between the colon and another part of the body (fistula) Hole or tear in the colon (perforation) Narrowed area in the colon (stricture) Pocket filled with pus or infection (abscess) Bleeding from the diverticula When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if symptoms of diverticulitis occur. Also call if you have diverticulitis and you have: Blood in your stools Fever above 100.4F (38C) that does not go away Nausea, vomiting, or chills Sudden belly or back pain that gets worse or is very severe Review Date 4/5/2018 Updated by: Michael M.

                "document": " Epilepsy Definition The epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity\u2014from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development\u2014can lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy. Treatment Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. For about 70 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. Some drugs are more effective for specific types of seizures. An individual with seizures, particularly those that are not easily controlled, may want to see a neurologist specifically trained to treat epilepsy. In some children, special diets may help to control seizures when medications are either not effective or cause serious side effects. Prognosis While epilepsy cannot be cured, for some people the seizures can be controlled with medication, diet, devices, and/or surgery. Most seizures do not cause brain damage, but ongoing uncontrolled seizures may cause brain damage. It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems in conjunction with seizures. Issues may also arise as a result of the stigma attached to having epilepsy, which can led to embarrassment and frustration or bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence (some states refuse drivers licenses to people with epilepsy) and recreational activities. Epilepsy can be a life-threatening condition. Some people with epilepsy are at special risk for abnormally prolonged seizures or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. ",

                "document": " Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Overview Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) features a pattern of unreasonable thoughts and fears (obsessions) that lead you to do repetitive behaviors (compulsions). These obsessions and compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause significant distress. You may try to ignore or stop your obsessions, but that only increases your distress and anxiety. Ultimately, you feel driven to perform compulsive acts to try to ease your stress. Despite efforts to ignore or get rid of bothersome thoughts or urges, they keep coming back. This leads to more ritualistic behavior - the vicious cycle of OCD. OCD often centers around certain themes - for example, a fear of getting contaminated by germs. To ease your contamination fears, you may compulsively wash your hands until they're sore and chapped. If you have OCD, you may be ashamed and embarrassed about the condition, but treatment can be effective. Symptoms Obsessive-compulsive disorder usually includes both obsessions and compulsions. But it's also possible to have only obsession symptoms or only compulsion symptoms. You may or may not realize that your obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable, but they take up a great deal of time and interfere with your daily routine and social or work functioning. OCD obsessions are repeated, persistent and unwanted thoughts, urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by performing a compulsive behavior or ritual. These obsessions typically intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things. Obsessions often have themes to them, such as: - Fear of contamination or dirt - Needing things orderly and symmetrical - Aggressive or horrific thoughts about harming yourself or others - Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects Examples of obsession signs and symptoms include: - Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched - Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove - Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way - Images of hurting yourself or someone else that are unwanted and make you uncomfortable - Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately that are unwanted and make you uncomfortable - Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands - Distress about unpleasant sexual images repeating in your mind OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to prevent or reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. However, engaging in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only a temporary relief from anxiety. You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts. These compulsions are excessive and often are not realistically related to the problem they're intended to fix. As with obsessions, compulsions typically have themes, such as: - Washing and cleaning - Checking - Counting - Orderliness - Following a strict routine - Demanding reassurances Examples of compulsion signs and symptoms include: - Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw - Checking doors repeatedly to make sure they're locked - Checking the stove repeatedly to make sure it's off - Counting in certain patterns - Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase - Arranging your canned goods to face the same way OCD usually begins in the teen or young adult years. Symptoms usually begin gradually and tend to vary in severity throughout life. Symptoms generally worsen when you experience greater stress. OCD, usually considered a lifelong disorder, can have mild to moderate symptoms or be so severe and time-consuming that it becomes disabling. There's a difference between being a perfectionist - someone who requires flawless results or performance, for example - and having OCD. OCD thoughts aren't simply excessive worries about real problems in your life or liking to have things clean or arranged in a specific way. If your obsessions and compulsions are affecting your quality of life, see your doctor or mental health professional. Causes The cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder isn't fully understood. Main theories include: - Biology. OCD may be a result of changes in your body's own natural chemistry or brain functions. - Genetics. OCD may have a genetic component, but specific genes have yet to be identified. - Environment. Some environmental factors such as infections are suggested as a trigger for OCD, but more research is needed. Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of developing or triggering obsessive-compulsive disorder include: - Family history. Having parents or other family members with the disorder can increase your risk of developing OCD. - Stressful life events. If you've experienced traumatic or stressful events, your risk may increase. This reaction may, for some reason, trigger the intrusive thoughts, rituals and emotional distress characteristic of OCD. - Other mental health disorders. OCD may be related to other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorders, depression, substance abuse or tic disorders. Complications Problems resulting from OCD may include, among others: - Health issues, such as contact dermatitis from frequent hand-washing - Inability to attend work, school or social activities - Troubled relationships - Overall poor quality of life - Suicidal thoughts and behavior Diagnosis Steps to help diagnose OCD may include: - Physical exam. This may be done to help rule out other problems that could be causing your symptoms and to check for any related complications. - Lab tests. These may include, for example, a complete blood count (CBC), a check of your thyroid function, and screening for alcohol and drugs. - Psychological evaluation. This includes discussing your thoughts, feelings, symptoms and behavior patterns. With your permission, this may include talking to your family or friends. - Diagnostic criteria for OCD. Your doctor may use criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic challenges It's sometimes difficult to diagnose OCD because symptoms can be similar to those of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, schizophrenia or other mental health disorders. And it's possible to have both OCD and another mental disorder. Work with your doctor so that you can get the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Treatment Obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment may not result in a cure, but it can help bring symptoms under control so that they don't rule your daily life. Some people need treatment for the rest of their lives. The two main treatments for OCD are psychotherapy and medications. Often, treatment is most effective with a combination of these. Psychotherapy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy, is effective for many people with OCD. Exposure and response prevention (ERP), a type of CBT therapy, involves gradually exposing you to a feared object or obsession, such as dirt, and having you learn healthy ways to cope with your anxiety. ERP takes effort and practice, but you may enjoy a better quality of life once you learn to manage your obsessions and compulsions. Therapy may take place in individual, family or group sessions. Medications Certain psychiatric medications can help control the obsessions and compulsions of OCD. Most commonly, antidepressants are tried first. Antidepressants approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat OCD include: - Clomipramine (Anafranil) for adults and children 10 years and older - Fluoxetine (Prozac) for adults and children 7 years and older - Fluvoxamine for adults and children 8 years and older - Paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) for adults only - Sertraline (Zoloft) for adults and children 6 years and older However, your doctor may prescribe other antidepressants and psychiatric medications. Medications: What to consider Here are some issues to discuss with your doctor about medications for OCD: - Choosing a medication. In general, the goal is to effectively control symptoms at the lowest possible dosage. It's not unusual to try several drugs before finding one that works well. Your doctor might recommend more than one medication to effectively manage your symptoms. It can take weeks to months after starting a medication to notice an improvement in symptoms. - Side effects. All psychiatric medications have potential side effects. Talk to your doctor about possible side effects and about any health monitoring needed while taking psychiatric drugs. And let your doctor know if you experience troubling side effects. - Suicide risk. Most antidepressants are generally safe, but the FDA requires that all antidepressants carry black box warnings, the strictest warnings for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teenagers and young adults under 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. If suicidal thoughts occur, immediately contact your doctor or get emergency help. Keep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood. - Interactions with other substances. When taking an antidepressant, tell your doctor about any other prescription or over-the-counter medications, herbs or other supplements you take. Some antidepressants can cause dangerous reactions when combined with certain medications or herbal supplements. - Stopping antidepressants. Antidepressants aren't considered addictive, but sometimes physical dependence (which is different from addiction) can occur. So stopping treatment abruptly or missing several doses can cause withdrawal-like symptoms, sometimes called discontinuation syndrome. Don't stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor, even if you're feeling better - you may have a relapse of OCD symptoms. Work with your doctor to gradually and safely decrease your dose. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using specific medications. Other treatment Sometimes, medications and psychotherapy aren't effective enough to control OCD symptoms. Research continues on the potential effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treating OCD that doesn't respond to traditional treatment approaches. Because DBS hasn't been thoroughly tested for use in treating OCD, make sure you understand all the pros and cons and possible health risks. Lifestyle and home remedies Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic condition, which means it may always be part of your life. While OCD warrants treatment by a professional, you can do some things for yourself to build on your treatment plan: - Take your medications as directed. Even if you're feeling well, resist any temptation to skip your medications. If you stop, OCD symptoms are likely to return. - Pay attention to warning signs. You and your doctor may have identified issues that can trigger your OCD symptoms. Make a plan so that you know what to do if symptoms return. Contact your doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms or how you feel. - Check first before taking other medications. Contact the doctor who's treating you for OCD before you take medications prescribed by another doctor or before taking any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, herbal remedies or other supplements to avoid possible interactions. - Practice what you learn. Work with your mental health professional to identify techniques and skills that help manage symptoms, and practice these regularly. ",

                "document": " Lymphoma Overview Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's germ-fighting network. The lymphatic system includes the lymph nodes (lymph glands), spleen, thymus gland and bone marrow. Lymphoma can affect all those areas as well as other organs throughout the body. Many types of lymphoma exist. The main subtypes are: - Hodgkin's lymphoma (formerly called Hodgkin's disease) - Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma What lymphoma treatment is best for you depends on your lymphoma type and its severity. Lymphoma treatment may involve chemotherapy, immunotherapy medications, radiation therapy, a bone marrow transplant or some combination of these. Lymphoma care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms Signs and symptoms of lymphoma may include: - Painless swelling of lymph nodes in your neck, armpits or groin - Persistent fatigue - Fever - Night sweats - Shortness of breath - Unexplained weight loss When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you. Causes Doctors aren't sure what causes lymphoma. But it begins when a disease-fighting white blood cell called a lymphocyte develops a genetic mutation. The mutation tells the cell to multiply rapidly, causing many diseased lymphocytes that continue multiplying. The mutation also allows the cells to go on living when other cells would die. This causes too many diseased and ineffective lymphocytes in your lymph nodes and causes the lymph nodes to swell. Diagnosis Tests and procedures used to diagnose lymphoma include: - Physical exam. Your doctor checks for swollen lymph nodes, including in your neck, underarm and groin, as well as a swollen spleen or liver. - Removing a lymph node for testing. Your doctor may recommend a lymph node biopsy procedure to remove all or part of a lymph node for laboratory testing. Advanced tests can determine if lymphoma cells are present and what types of cells are involved. - Blood tests. Blood tests to count the number of cells in a sample of your blood can give your doctor clues about your diagnosis. - Removing a sample of bone marrow for testing. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy procedure involves inserting a needle into your hipbone to remove a sample of bone marrow. The sample is analyzed to look for lymphoma cells. - Imaging tests. Your doctor may recommend imaging tests to look for signs of lymphoma in other areas of your body. Tests may include CT, MRI and positron emission tomography (PET). Other tests and procedures may be used depending on your situation. Many types of lymphoma exist, including rare forms that are difficult for inexperienced pathologists to identify. An accurate diagnosis is key to developing a treatment plan. Research shows that review of biopsy tests by pathologists who aren't experienced with lymphoma results in a significant proportion of misdiagnoses. Get a second opinion from a specialist. Treatment Which lymphoma treatments are right for you depends on the type and stage of your disease, your overall health, and your preferences. The goal of treatment is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible and bring the disease into remission. Lymphoma treatments include: - Active surveillance. Some forms of lymphoma are very slow growing. You and your doctor may decide to wait to treat your lymphoma when it causes signs and symptoms that interfere with your daily activities. Until then, you may undergo periodic tests to monitor your condition. - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy fast-growing cells, such as cancer cells. The drugs are usually administered through a vein, but can also be taken as a pill, depending on the specific drugs you receive. - Other drug therapy. Other drugs used to treat lymphoma include targeted drugs that focus on specific abnormalities in your cancer cells. Immunotherapy drugs use your immune system to kill cancer cells. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. - Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, involves using high doses of chemotherapy and radiation to suppress your bone marrow. Then healthy bone marrow stem cells from your body or from a donor are infused into your blood where they travel to your bones and rebuild your bone marrow. Alternative medicine No supplements have been found to treat lymphoma. But integrative medicine may help you cope with the stress of a cancer diagnosis and the side effects of cancer treatment. Talk to your doctor about your options, such as: - Physical activity - Art therapy - Meditation - Music therapy - Relaxation exercises - Acupuncture - Massage ",

                "document": " Bronchitis Overview Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from your lungs. People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may be either acute or chronic. Often developing from a cold or other respiratory infection, acute bronchitis is very common. Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking. Acute bronchitis, also called a chest cold, usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks. However, if you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Symptoms For either acute bronchitis or chronic bronchitis, signs and symptoms may include: - Cough - Production of mucus (sputum), which can be clear, white, yellowish-gray or green in color - rarely, it may be streaked with blood - Fatigue - Shortness of breath - Slight fever and chills - Chest discomfort If you have acute bronchitis, you might have cold symptoms, such as a mild headache or body aches. While these symptoms usually improve in about a week, you may have a nagging cough that lingers for several weeks. Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough that lasts at least three months, with recurring bouts occurring for at least two consecutive years. If you have chronic bronchitis, you're likely to have periods when your cough or other symptoms worsen. At those times, you may have an acute infection on top of chronic bronchitis. See your doctor if your cough: - Lasts more than three weeks - Prevents you from sleeping - Is accompanied by fever higher than 100.4 F (38 C) - Produces discolored mucus - Produces blood - Is associated with wheezing or shortness of breath Causes Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, typically the same viruses that cause colds and flu (influenza). Antibiotics don't kill viruses, so this type of medication isn't useful in most cases of bronchitis. The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is cigarette smoking. Air pollution and dust or toxic gases in the environment or workplace also can contribute to the condition. Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of bronchitis include: - Cigarette smoke. People who smoke or who live with a smoker are at higher risk of both acute bronchitis and chronic bronchitis. - Low resistance. This may result from another acute illness, such as a cold, or from a chronic condition that compromises your immune system. Older adults, infants and young children have greater vulnerability to infection. - Exposure to irritants on the job. Your risk of developing bronchitis is greater if you work around certain lung irritants, such as grains or textiles, or are exposed to chemical fumes. - Gastric reflux. Repeated bouts of severe heartburn can irritate your throat and make you more prone to developing bronchitis. Complications Although a single episode of bronchitis usually isn't cause for concern, it can lead to pneumonia in some people. Repeated bouts of bronchitis, however, may mean that you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Diagnosis During the first few days of illness, it can be difficult to distinguish the signs and symptoms of bronchitis from those of a common cold. During the physical exam, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen closely to your lungs as you breathe. In some cases, your doctor may suggest the following tests: - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can help determine if you have pneumonia or another condition that may explain your cough. This is especially important if you ever were or currently are a smoker. - Sputum tests. Sputum is the mucus that you cough up from your lungs. It can be tested to see if you have illnesses that could be helped by antibiotics. Sputum can also be tested for signs of allergies. - Pulmonary function test. During a pulmonary function test, you blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can hold and how quickly you can get air out of your lungs. This test checks for signs of asthma or emphysema. Treatment Most cases of acute bronchitis get better without treatment, usually within a couple of weeks. Medications Because most cases of bronchitis are caused by viral infections, antibiotics aren't effective. However, if your doctor suspects that you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe an antibiotic. In some circumstances, your doctor may recommend other medications, including: - Cough medicine. If your cough keeps you from sleeping, you might try cough suppressants at bedtime. - Other medications. If you have allergies, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), your doctor may recommend an inhaler and other medications to reduce inflammation and open narrowed passages in your lungs. Therapies If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation - a breathing exercise program in which a respiratory therapist teaches you how to breathe more easily and increase your ability to exercise. Lifestyle and home remedies To help you feel better, you may want to try the following self-care measures: - Avoid lung irritants. Don't smoke. Wear a mask when the air is polluted or if you're exposed to irritants, such as paint or household cleaners with strong fumes. - Use a humidifier. Warm, moist air helps relieve coughs and loosens mucus in your airways. But be sure to clean the humidifier according to the manufacturer's recommendations to avoid the growth of bacteria and fungi in the water container. - Consider a face mask outside. If cold air aggravates your cough and causes shortness of breath, put on a cold-air face mask before you go outside. ",

                "document": " Diabetes type 2 - meal planning Type 2 diabetes diet Diet - diabetes - type 2 Summary When you have type 2 diabetes, taking time to plan your meals goes a long way toward controlling your blood sugar and weight. Function Your main focus is on keeping your blood sugar (glucose) level in your target range. To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has: Food from all the food groups Fewer calories About the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal and snack Healthy fats Along with healthy eating, you can help keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. People with type 2 diabetes are often overweight or obese. Losing even 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 60 total minutes of walking or other activity per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. HOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR Carbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food. The main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range. Not all carbohydrates can be broken down and absorbed by your body. Foods with more non-digestable carbohydrates, or fiber, are less likely to increase your blood sugar out of your goal range. These include foods such as beans and whole grains. MEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES Meal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be able to reach a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (60 minutes each day). Work with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition. The following tips can help your child stay on track: No food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your child's blood sugar helps you and your child keep blood sugar in target range. Help your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control. Have your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk. PLANNING MEALS Everyone has individual needs. Work with your doctor, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you. When shopping, read food labels to make better food choices. A good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate). You can find more information about the plate method at the American Diabetes Association website: www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/planning-meals/create-your-plate/. EAT A VARIETY OF FOODS Eating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal. VEGETABLES (21/2 to 3 cups or 450 to 550 grams a day) Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro. Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable. FRUITS (11/2 to 2 cups or 240 to 320 grams a day) Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups. GRAINS (3 to 4 ounces or 85 to 115 grams a day) There are 2 types of grains: Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa. Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice. Grains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. For healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast. PROTEIN FOODS (5 to 61/2 ounces or 140 to 184 grams a day) Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods. Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying. When frying proteins, use healthy oils such as olive oil. DAIRY (3 cups or 245 grams a day) Choose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. Some non-fat dairy products have a lot of added sugar. Be sure to read the label. OILS/FATS (no more than 7 teaspoons or 35 milliliters a day) Oils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature. Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter. Instead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. Oils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons (35 milliliters). WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS? If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar and to determine a safe amount for you. Sweets are high in fat and sugar. Keep portion sizes small. Here are tips to help avoid eating too many sweets: Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others. Eat sweets that are sugar-free. Always ask for the smallest serving size or children's size. YOUR DIABETES CARE TEAM IS THERE TO HELP YOU In the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you're having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team. They are there to help you. Review Date 2/22/2018 Updated by: Robert Hurd, MD, Professor of Endocrinology and Health Care Ethics, Xavier University, Cincinnati, OH.

But staph infections can turn deadly if the bacteria invade deeper into your body, entering your bloodstream, joints, bones, lungs or heart. A growing number of otherwise healthy people are developing life-threatening staph infections. Treatment usually involves antibiotics and drainage of the infected area. However, some staph infections no longer respond to common antibiotics. Symptoms Staph infections can range from minor skin problems to endocarditis, a life-threatening infection of the inner lining of your heart (endocardium). As a result, signs and symptoms of staph infections vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the infection. Skin infections caused by staph bacteria include: - Boils. The most common type of staph infection is the boil, a pocket of pus that develops in a hair follicle or oil gland. The skin over the infected area usually becomes red and swollen. If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus. Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks. - Impetigo. This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually features large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust. - Cellulitis. Cellulitis - an infection of the deeper layers of skin - causes skin redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores (ulcers) or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too. - Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Toxins produced as a result of a staph infection may lead to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition features fever, a rash and sometimes blisters. When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off - leaving a red, raw surface that looks like a burn. Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning. Symptoms come on quickly, usually within hours of eating a contaminated food. Symptoms usually disappear quickly, too, often lasting just half a day. A staph infection in food usually doesn't cause a fever. Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include: - Nausea and vomiting - Diarrhea - Dehydration - Low blood pressure Also known as blood poisoning, septicemia occurs when staph bacteria enter a person's bloodstream. A fever and low blood pressure are signs of septicemia. The bacteria can travel to locations deep within your body, to produce infections affecting: - Internal organs, such as your brain, heart or lungs - Bones and muscles - Surgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints or cardiac pacemakers This life-threatening condition results from toxins produced by some strains of staph bacteria and has been linked to certain types of tampons, skin wounds and surgery. It usually develops suddenly with: - A high fever - Nausea and vomiting - A rash on your palms and soles that resembles sunburn - Confusion - Muscle aches - Diarrhea - Abdominal pain Septic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection. The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes. Signs and symptoms may include: - Joint swelling - Severe pain in the affected joint - Fever Go to the doctor if you or your child has: - An area of red, irritated or painful skin - Pus-filled blisters - Fever You may also want to consult your doctor if: - Skin infections are being passed from one family member to another - Two or more family members have skin infections at the same time Causes Many people carry staph bacteria and never develop staph infections. However, if you develop a staph infection, there's a good chance that it's from bacteria you've been carrying around for some time. These bacteria can also be transmitted from person to person. Because staph bacteria are so hardy, they can live on inanimate objects such as pillowcases or towels long enough to transfer to the next person who touches them. Staph bacteria are able to survive: - Drying - Extremes of temperature - Stomach acid - High levels of salt Risk factors A variety of factors - including the status of your immune system to the types of sports you play - can increase your risk of developing staph infections. Certain disorders or the medications used to treat them can make you more susceptible to staph infections. People who may be more likely to get a staph infection include those with: - Diabetes who use insulin - HIV/AIDS - Kidney failure requiring dialysis - Weakened immune systems - either from a disease or medications that suppress the immune system - Cancer, especially those who are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation - Skin damage from conditions such as eczema, insect bites or minor trauma that opens the skin - Respiratory illness, such as cystic fibrosis or emphysema Despite vigorous attempts to eradicate them, staph bacteria remain present in hospitals, where they attack the most vulnerable, including people with: - Weakened immune systems - Burns - Surgical wounds Staph bacteria can travel along the medical tubing that connects the outside world with your internal organs. Examples include: - Dialysis tubing - Urinary catheters - Feeding tubes - Breathing tubes - Intravascular catheters Staph bacteria can spread easily through cuts, abrasions and skin-to-skin contact. Staph infections may also spread in the locker room through shared razors, towels, uniforms or equipment. Food handlers who don't properly wash their hands can transfer staph from their skin to the food they're preparing. Foods that are contaminated with staph look and taste normal. Complications If staph bacteria invade your bloodstream, you may develop a type of infection that affects your entire body. Called sepsis, this infection can lead to septic shock - a life-threatening episode with extremely low blood pressure. Diagnosis To diagnose a staph infection, your doctor will: - Perform a physical exam. During the exam, your doctor will closely examine any skin lesions you may have. - Collect a sample for testing. Most often, doctors diagnose staph infections by checking a tissue sample or nasal secretions for signs of the bacteria. Treatment Treatment of a staph infection may include: - Antibiotics. Your doctor may perform tests to identify of the staph bacteria behind your infection, and to help choose the antibiotic that will work best. Antibiotics commonly prescribed to treat staph infections include certain cephalosporins, nafcillin or related antibiotics, sulfa drugs, or vancomycin. Vancomycin increasingly is required to treat serious staph infections because so many strains of staph bacteria have become resistant to other traditional medicines. But vancomycin and some other antibiotics have to be given intravenously. If you're given an oral antibiotic, be sure to take it as directed, and to finish all of the medication prescribed by your doctor. Ask your doctor what signs and symptoms you should watch for that might indicate your infection is worsening. - Wound drainage. If you have a skin infection, your doctor will likely make an incision into the sore to drain fluid that has collected there. - Device removal. If your infection involves a device or prosthetic, prompt removal of the device is needed. For some devices, removal might require surgery. Antibiotic resistance Staph bacteria are very adaptable, and many varieties have become resistant to one or more antibiotics. For example, only about 10 percent of today's staph infections can be cured with penicillin. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of staph bacteria - often described as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains - has led to the use of IV antibiotics, such as vancomycin, with the potential for more side effects, such as vancomycin.

                "document": " Leber congenital amaurosis amaurosis, Leber congenital congenital amaurosis of retinal origin congenital retinal blindness CRB dysgenesis neuroepithelialis retinae hereditary epithelial dysplasia of retina hereditary retinal aplasia heredoretinopathia congenitalis LCA Leber abiotrophy Leber congenital tapetoretinal degeneration Leber's amaurosis Description Leber congenital amaurosis is an eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. The visual impairment tends to be stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time. Leber congenital amaurosis is also associated with other vision problems, including an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). The pupils, which usually expand and contract in response to the amount of light entering the eye, do not react normally to light. Instead, they expand and contract more slowly than normal, or they may not respond to light at all. Additionally, the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea) may be cone-shaped and abnormally thin, a condition known as keratoconus. A specific behavior called Franceschetti's oculo-digital sign is characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis. This sign consists of poking, pressing, and rubbing the eyes with a knuckle or finger. Researchers suspect that this behavior may contribute to deep-set eyes and keratoconus in affected children. In rare cases, delayed development and intellectual disability have been reported in people with the features of Leber congenital amaurosis. However, researchers are uncertain whether these individuals actually have Leber congenital amaurosis or another syndrome with similar signs and symptoms. At least 13 types of Leber congenital amaurosis have been described. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause, patterns of vision loss, and related eye abnormalities. Frequency Leber congenital amaurosis occurs in 2 to 3 per 100,000 newborns. It is one of the most common causes of blindness in children. Causes Leber congenital amaurosis can result from mutations in at least 14 genes, all of which are necessary for normal vision. These genes play a variety of roles in the development and function of the retina. For example, some of the genes associated with this disorder are necessary for the normal development of light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. Other genes are involved in phototransduction, the process by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. Still other genes play a role in the function of cilia, which are microscopic finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of many types of cells. Cilia are necessary for the perception of several types of sensory input, including vision. Mutations in any of the genes associated with Leber congenital amaurosis disrupt the development and function of the retina, resulting in early vision loss. Mutations in the CEP290, CRB1, GUCY2D, and RPE65 genes are the most common causes of the disorder, while mutations in the other genes generally account for a smaller percentage of cases. In about 30 percent of all people with Leber congenital amaurosis, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Inheritance Pattern Leber congenital amaurosis usually has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. When Leber congenital amaurosis is caused by mutations in the CRX or IMPDH1 genes, the disorder has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, an affected person inherits a gene mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.

                "document": " Congenital diaphragmatic hernia congenital diaphragmatic defect Description Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth. In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare. Frequency Congenital diaphragmatic hernia affects approximately 1 in 2,500 newborns. Causes Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes. About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations. More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified. Inheritance Pattern Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family. When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.

                "document": " Duchenne muscular dystrophy Pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy Muscular dystrophy - Duchenne type Summary Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder. It involves muscle weakness, which quickly gets worse. Causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a form of muscular dystrophy. It worsens quickly. Other muscular dystrophies (including Becker muscular dystrophy) get worse much more slowly. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin (a protein in the muscles). However, it often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition. The condition most often affects boys due to the way the disease is inherited. The sons of women who are carriers of the disease (women with a defective gene, but no symptoms themselves) each have a 50% chance of having the disease. The daughters each have a 50% chance of being carriers. Very rarely, a female can be affected by the disease. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs in about 1 out of every 3,600 male infants. Because this is an inherited disorder, risks include a family history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Symptoms Symptoms most often appear before age 6. They may come on as early as infancy. Most boys show no symptoms in the first few years of life. Symptoms may include: Fatigue Learning difficulties (the IQ can be below 75) Intellectual disability (possible, but does not get worse over time) Muscle weakness: Begins in the legs and pelvis, but also occurs less severely in the arms, neck, and other areas of the body Problems with motor skills (running, hopping, jumping) Frequent falls Trouble getting up from a lying position or climbing stairs Shortness of breath, fatigue and swelling of the feet due to a weakening of the heart muscle Problem breathing due to a weakening of the respiratory muscles Gradual worsening of muscle weakness Progressive difficulty walking: Ability to walk may be lost by age 12, and the child will have to use a wheelchair. Breathing difficulties and heart disease often start by age 20. Exams and Tests A complete nervous system (neurological), heart, lung, and muscle exam may show: Abnormal heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) becomes evident by the age of 10. Congestive heart failure or irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia) is present in all people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy by the age of 18. Deformities of the chest and back (scoliosis). Enlarged muscles of the calves, buttocks, and shoulders (around age 4 or 5). These muscles are eventually replaced by fat and connective tissue (pseudohypertrophy). Loss of muscle mass (wasting). Muscle contractures in the heels, legs. Muscle deformities. Respiratory disorders, including pneumonia and swallowing with food or fluid passing into the lungs (in late stages of the disease). Tests may include: Electromyography (EMG) Genetic tests Muscle biopsy Serum CPK Treatment There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Treatment aims to control symptoms to improve quality of life. Steroid drugs can slow the loss of muscle strength. They may be started when the child is diagnosed or when muscle strength begins to decline. Other treatments may include: Albuterol, a drug used for people with asthma Amino acids Carnitine Coenzyme Q10 Creatine Fish oil Green tea extracts Vitamin E However, the effects of these treatments have not been proven. Stem cells and gene therapy may be used in the future. The use of steroids and the lack of physical activity can lead to excessive weight gain. Activity is encouraged. Inactivity (such as bedrest) can make the muscle disease worse. Physical therapy may help to maintain muscle strength and function. Speech therapy is often needed. Other treatments may include: Assisted ventilation (used during the day or night) Drugs to help heart function, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and diuretics Orthopedic appliances (such as braces and wheelchairs) to improve mobility Spine surgery to treat progressive scoliosis for some people Proton pump inhibitors (for people with gastroesophageal reflux) Several new treatments are being studied in trials. Support Groups You can ease the stress of illness by joining a support group where members share common experiences and problems. The Muscular Dystrophy Association is an excellent source of information on this disease. Outlook (Prognosis) Duchenne muscular dystrophy leads to progressively worsening disability. Death often occurs by age 25, typically from lung disorders. However, advances in supportive care have resulted in many men living longer. Possible Complications Complications may include: Cardiomyopathy (can also occur in female carriers, who should also be screened) Congestive heart failure (rare) Deformities Heart arrhythmias (rare) Mental impairment (varies, usually minimal) Permanent, progressive disability, including decreased mobility and decreased ability to care for self Pneumonia or other respiratory infections Respiratory failure When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your health care provider if: Your child has symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Symptoms get worse or new symptoms develop, particularly fever with cough or breathing problems. Prevention People with a family history of the disorder may want to seek genetic counseling. Genetic studies done during pregnancy are very accurate in detecting Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

                "document": " Hiatal hernia Hernia - hiatal Summary Hiatal hernia is a condition in which part of the stomach extends through an opening of the diaphragm into the chest. The diaphragm is the sheet of muscle that divides the chest from the abdomen. Causes The exact cause of hiatal hernia is unknown. The condition may be due to weakness of the supporting tissue. Your risk for the problem goes up with age, obesity, and smoking. Hiatal hernias are very common. The problem occurs often in people over 50 years. This condition may cause reflux (backflow) of gastric acid from the stomach into the esophagus. Children with this condition are most often born with it (congenital). It often occurs with gastroesophageal reflux in infants. Symptoms Symptoms may include: Chest pain Heartburn, worse when bending over or lying down Swallowing difficulty A hiatal hernia by itself rarely causes symptoms. Pain and discomfort are due to the upward flow of stomach acid, air, or bile. Exams and Tests Tests that may be used include: Barium swallow x-ray Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) Treatment The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Treatments may include: Medicines to control stomach acid Surgery to repair the hiatal hernia and prevent reflux Other measures to reduce symptoms include: Avoiding large or heavy meals Not lying down or bending over right after a meal Reducing weight and not smoking Raising the head of the bed 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) If medicines and lifestyle measures do not help control symptoms, you may need surgery. Outlook (Prognosis) Treatment can relieve most symptoms of hiatal hernia. Possible Complications Complications may include: Pulmonary (lung) aspiration Slow bleeding and iron deficiency anemia (due to a large hernia) Strangulation (closing off) of the hernia When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your health care provider if: You have symptoms of a hiatal hernia. You have a hiatal hernia and your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment. You develop new symptoms. Prevention Controlling risk factors such as obesity may help prevent hiatal hernia.

                "document": " Gastroparesis Overview Gastroparesis is a condition that affects the normal spontaneous movement of the muscles (motility) in your stomach. Ordinarily, strong muscular contractions propel food through your digestive tract. But if you have gastroparesis, your stomach's motility is slowed down or doesn't work at all, preventing your stomach from emptying properly. Certain medications, such as opioid pain relievers, some antidepressants, and high blood pressure and allergy medications, can lead to slow gastric emptying and cause similar symptoms. For people who already have gastroparesis, these medications may make their condition worse. Gastroparesis can interfere with normal digestion, cause nausea and vomiting, and cause problems with blood sugar levels and nutrition. The cause of gastroparesis is usually unknown. Sometimes it's a complication of diabetes, and some people develop gastroparesis after surgery. Although there's no cure for gastroparesis, changes to your diet, along with medication, can offer some relief. Gastroparesis care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms Signs and symptoms of gastroparesis include: - Vomiting - Nausea - A feeling of fullness after eating just a few bites - Vomiting undigested food eaten a few hours earlier - Acid reflux - Abdominal bloating - Abdominal pain - Changes in blood sugar levels - Lack of appetite - Weight loss and malnutrition Many people with gastroparesis don't have any noticeable signs and symptoms. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. Causes It's not always clear what leads to gastroparesis. But in many cases, gastroparesis is believed to be caused by damage to a nerve that controls the stomach muscles (vagus nerve). The vagus nerve helps manage the complex processes in your digestive tract, including signaling the muscles in your stomach to contract and push food into the small intestine. A damaged vagus nerve can't send signals normally to your stomach muscles. This may cause food to remain in your stomach longer, rather than move normally into your small intestine to be digested. The vagus nerve can be damaged by diseases, such as diabetes, or by surgery to the stomach or small intestine. Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of gastroparesis: - Diabetes - Abdominal or esophageal surgery - Infection, usually a virus - Certain medications that slow the rate of stomach emptying, such as narcotic pain medications - Scleroderma (a connective tissue disease) - Nervous system diseases, such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis - Hypothyroidism (low thyroid) Women are more likely to develop gastroparesis than are men. Diagnosis Doctors use several tests to help diagnose gastroparesis and rule out conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Tests may include: - Gastric emptying study. This is the most important test used in making a diagnosis of gastroparesis. It involves eating a light meal, such as eggs and toast, that contains a small amount of radioactive material. A scanner that detects the movement of the radioactive material is placed over your abdomen to monitor the rate at which food leaves your stomach. You'll need to stop taking any medications that could slow gastric emptying. Ask your doctor if any of your medications might slow your digestion. - Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure is used to visually examine your upper digestive system - your esophagus, stomach and beginning of the small intestine (duodenum) - with a tiny camera on the end of a long, flexible tube.This test can also diagnose other conditions, such as peptic ulcer disease or pyloric stenosis, which can have symptoms similar to those of gastroparesis. - Ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of structures within your body. Ultrasound can help diagnose whether problems with your gallbladder or your kidneys could be causing your symptoms. - Upper gastrointestinal series. This is a series of X-rays in which you drink a white, chalky liquid (barium) that coats the digestive system to help abnormalities show up. Treatment Treating gastroparesis begins with identifying and treating the underlying condition. If diabetes is causing your gastroparesis, your doctor can work with you to help you control it. Changes to your diet Maintaining adequate nutrition is the most important goal in the treatment of gastroparesis. Many people can manage gastroparesis with diet changes and dietary changes are the first step in managing this condition. Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian who can work with you to find foods that are easier for you to digest so that you're more likely to get enough calories and nutrients from the food you eat. A dietitian might suggest that you try to: - Eat smaller meals more frequently - Chew food thoroughly - Eat well-cooked fruits and vegetables rather than raw fruits and vegetables - Avoid fibrous fruits and vegetables, such as oranges and broccoli, which may cause bezoars - Choose mostly low-fat foods, but if you can tolerate them, add small servings of fatty foods to your diet - Try soups and pureed foods if liquids are easier for you to swallow - Drink about 34 to 51 ounces (1 to 1.5 liters) of water a day - Exercise gently after you eat, such as going for a walk - Avoid carbonated drinks, alcohol and smoking - Try to avoid lying down for 2 hours after a meal - Take a multivitamin daily Here's a brief list of foods recommended for people with gastroparesis (your dietitian can give you a more comprehensive list): - White bread and rolls and \"light\" whole-wheat bread without nuts or seeds - Plain or egg bagels - English muffins - Flour or corn tortillas - Pancakes - Puffed wheat and rice cereals - Cream of wheat or rice - White crackers - Potatoes, white or sweet (no skin) - Baked french fries - Rice - Pasta - Lean beef, veal and pork (not fried) - Chicken or turkey (no skin and not fried) - Crab, lobster, shrimp, clams, scallops, oysters - Tuna (packed in water) - Cottage cheese - Eggs - Tofu - Strained meat baby food - Baby food vegetables and fruits - Tomato sauce, paste, puree, juice - Carrots (cooked) - Beets (cooked) - Mushrooms (cooked) - Vegetable juice - Vegetable broth - Fruit juices and drinks - Applesauce - Bananas - Peaches and pears (canned) - Milk, if tolerated - Yogurt (without fruit pieces) - Custard and pudding - Frozen yogurt Medications Medications to treat gastroparesis may include: - Medications to stimulate the stomach muscles. These medications include metoclopramide (Reglan) and erythromycin (Eryc, E.E.S.). Metoclopramide has a risk of serious side effects. Erythromycin may lose its effectiveness over time, and can cause side effects, such as diarrhea. A newer medication, domperidone, with fewer side effects, is also available with restricted access. - Medications to control nausea and vomiting. Drugs that help ease nausea and vomiting include prochlorperazine (Compro) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Unisom). A class of medications that includes ondansetron (Zofran) is sometimes used to help nausea and vomiting. Surgical treatment Some people with gastroparesis may be unable to tolerate any food or liquids. In these situations, doctors may recommend a feeding tube (jejunostomy tube) be placed in the small intestine. Or doctors may recommend a gastric venting tube to help relieve pressure from gastric contents. Feeding tubes can be passed through your nose or mouth or directly into your small intestine through your skin. The tube is usually temporary and is only used when gastroparesis is severe or when blood sugar levels can't be controlled by any other method. Some people may require an IV (parenteral) feeding tube that goes directly into a vein in the chest. Treatments under investigation Researchers are continuing to investigate new medications to treat gastroparesis. One example is a new drug in development called relamorelin. The results of a phase 2 clinical trial found the drug could speed up gastric emptying and reduce vomiting. The drug is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but a larger clinical trial is currently underway. A number of new therapies are being tried with the help of endoscopy - a slender tube that's threaded down the esophagus. One procedure used endoscopy to place a small tube (stent) where the stomach connects to the small intestine (duodenum) to keep this connection open. Several research trials investigated the use of botulinum toxin administered through endoscopy without much success. This treatment is not recommended. Doctors are also studying the use of a minimally invasive surgical technique when someone needs a feeding tube placed directly into the small intestine (jejunostomy tube). Gastric electrical stimulation and pacing Gastric electrical stimulation is a surgically implanted device that provides electrical stimulation to stimulate stomach muscles to move food more efficiently. Study results have been mixed. However, the device seems to be most helpful for people with diabetic gastroparesis. The FDA allows the device to be used under a compassionate use exemption for those who can't control their gastroparesis symptoms with diet changes or medications. However, larger studies are needed. Gastric pacing also involves a surgically implanted device that stimulates the stomach muscles, but this device tries to more closely mimic normal stomach contractions. Currently, the device is too large and causes discomfort. Gastric pacing devices are only available in clinical trials right now. Lifestyle and home remedies If you're a smoker, stop. Your gastroparesis symptoms are less likely to improve over time if you keep smoking. People with gastroparesis who are overweight are also less likely to get better over time. Alternative medicine There is some evidence that certain alternative treatments can be helpful to people with gastroparesis, although more studies are needed. Some treatments that look promising include: - Acupuncture and electroacupuncture. Acupuncture involves the insertion of extremely thin needles through your skin at strategic points on your body. During electroacupuncture, a small electrical current is passed through the needles. Studies have shown these treatments to ease gastroparesis symptoms more than a sham treatment. - STW 5 (Iberogast). This herbal formula from Germany contains nine different herbal extracts. It hasn't been shown to speed up gastric emptying, but was slightly better at easing digestive symptoms than a placebo. - Rikkunshito. This Japanese herbal formula also contains nine herbs. It may help reduce abdominal pain and the feeling of post-meal fullness. - Cannabis. There aren't any published clinical trials on cannabis and gastroparesis. However, cannabis - commonly known as marijuana - is thought to ease nausea and other digestive complaints. Derivatives of cannabis have been used by people who have cancer in the past, but there are better FDA-approved medications available to control nausea now. Because cannabis is often smoked, there's concern about possible addiction and harm, similar to what occurs with tobacco smoke. In addition, daily users of marijuana (cannabis) may develop a condition that mimics the symptoms of gastroparesis called cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Quitting cannabis may help. ",

                "document": " Facts About Glaucoma What is Glaucoma? Glaucoma is a group of diseases that damage the eye's optic nerve and can result in vision loss and blindness. However, with early detection and treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss. <strong>The optic nerve</strong> The optic nerve is a bundle of more than 1 million nerve fibers. It connects the retina to the brain. (See diagram above.) The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. A healthy optic nerve is necessary for good vision. How does the optic nerve get damaged by open-angle glaucoma? Several large studies have shown that eye pressure is a major risk factor for optic nerve damage. In the front of the eye is a space called the anterior chamber. A clear fluid flows continuously in and out of the chamber and nourishes nearby tissues. The fluid leaves the chamber at the open angle where the cornea and iris meet. (See diagram below.) When the fluid reaches the angle, it flows through a spongy meshwork, like a drain, and leaves the eye. In open-angle glaucoma, even though the drainage angle is \"open\", the fluid passes too slowly through the meshwork drain. Since the fluid builds up, the pressure inside the eye rises to a level that may damage the optic nerve. When the optic nerve is damaged from increased pressure, open-angle glaucoma-and vision loss-may result. That's why controlling pressure inside the eye is important. Another risk factor for optic nerve damage relates to blood pressure. Thus, it is important to also make sure that your blood pressure is at a proper level for your body by working with your medical doctor. Fluid pathway is shown in teal. Can I develop glaucoma if I have increased eye pressure? Not necessarily. Not every person with increased eye pressure will develop glaucoma. Some people can tolerate higher levels of eye pressure better than others. Also, a certain level of eye pressure may be high for one person but normal for another. Whether you develop glaucoma depends on the level of pressure your optic nerve can tolerate without being damaged. This level is different for each person. That's why a comprehensive dilated eye exam is very important. It can help your eye care professional determine what level of eye pressure is normal for you. Can I develop glaucoma without an increase in my eye pressure? Yes. Glaucoma can develop without increased eye pressure. This form of glaucoma is called low-tension or normal-tension glaucoma. It is a type of open-angle glaucoma. Who is at risk for open-angle glaucoma? Anyone can develop glaucoma. Some people, listed below, are at higher risk than others: <li>African Americans over age 40</li> <li>Everyone over age 60, especially Mexican Americans</li> <li>People with a family history of glaucoma</li> A comprehensive dilated eye exam can reveal more risk factors, such as high eye pressure, thinness of the cornea, and abnormal optic nerve anatomy. In some people with certain combinations of these high-risk factors, medicines in the form of eyedrops reduce the risk of developing glaucoma by about half. Glaucoma Symptoms At first, open-angle glaucoma has no symptoms. It causes no pain. Vision stays normal. Glaucoma can develop in one or both eyes. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral (side) vision. As glaucoma remains untreated, people may miss objects to the side and out of the corner of their eye. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead (central) vision may decrease until no vision remains. Normal Vision. The same scene as viewed by a person with glaucoma. How is glaucoma detected? Glaucoma is detected through a comprehensive dilated eye exam that includes the following: <strong>Visual acuity test</strong>. This eye chart test measures how well you see at various distances. <strong>Visual field test</strong>. This test measures your peripheral (side vision). It helps your eye care professional tell if you have lost peripheral vision, a sign of glaucoma. <strong>Dilated eye exam</strong>. In this exam, drops are placed in your eyes to widen, or dilate, the pupils. Your eye care professional uses a special magnifying lens to examine your retina and optic nerve for signs of damage and other eye problems. After the exam, your close-up vision may remain blurred for several hours. <strong>Tonometry</strong> is the measurement of pressure inside the eye by using an instrument called a tonometer. Numbing drops may be applied to your eye for this test. A tonometer measures pressure inside the eye to detect glaucoma. <strong>Pachymetry</strong> is the measurement of the thickness of your cornea. Your eye care professional applies a numbing drop to your eye and uses an ultrasonic wave instrument to measure the thickness of your cornea. Can glaucoma be cured? No. There is no cure for glaucoma. Vision lost from the disease cannot be restored. Glaucoma Treatments Immediate treatment for early-stage, open-angle glaucoma can delay progression of the disease. That's why early diagnosis is very important. Glaucoma treatments include medicines, laser trabeculoplasty, conventional surgery, or a combination of any of these. While these treatments may save remaining vision, they do not improve sight already lost from glaucoma. <strong>Medicines</strong>. Medicines, in the form of eyedrops or pills, are the most common early treatment for glaucoma. Taken regularly, these eyedrops lower eye pressure. Some medicines cause the eye to make less fluid. Others lower pressure by helping fluid drain from the eye. Before you begin glaucoma treatment, tell your eye care professional about other medicines and supplements that you are taking. Sometimes the drops can interfere with the way other medicines work. Glaucoma medicines need to be taken regularly as directed by your eye care professional. Most people have no problems. However, some medicines can cause headaches or other side effects. For example, drops may cause stinging, burning, and redness in the eyes. Many medicines are available to treat glaucoma. If you have problems with one medicine, tell your eye care professional. Treatment with a different dose or a new medicine may be possible. Because glaucoma often has no symptoms, people may be tempted to stop taking, or may forget to take, their medicine. You need to use the drops or pills as long as they help control your eye pressure. Regular use is very important. A tonometer measures pressure inside the eye to detect glaucoma. Make sure your eye care professional shows you how to put the drops into your eye. For tips on using your glaucoma eyedrops, see the inside back cover of this booklet. <strong>Laser trabeculoplasty</strong>. Laser trabeculoplasty helps fluid drain out of the eye. Your doctor may suggest this step at any time. In many cases, you will need to keep taking glaucoma medicines after this procedure. Laser trabeculoplasty is performed in your doctor's office or eye clinic. Before the surgery, numbing drops are applied to your eye. As you sit facing the laser machine, your doctor holds a special lens to your eye. A high-intensity beam of light is aimed through the lens and reflected onto the meshwork inside your eye. You may see flashes of bright green or red light. The laser makes several evenly spaced burns that stretch the drainage holes in the meshwork. This allows the fluid to drain better. Like any surgery, laser surgery can cause side effects, such as inflammation. Your doctor may give you some drops to take home for any soreness or inflammation inside the eye. You will need to make several follow-up visits to have your eye pressure and eye monitored. If you have glaucoma in both eyes, usually only one eye will be treated at a time. Laser treatments for each eye will be scheduled several days to several weeks apart. Studies show that laser surgery can be very good at reducing the pressure in some patients. However, its effects can wear off over time. Your doctor may suggest further treatment. <strong>Conventional surgery</strong>. Conventional surgery makes a new opening for the fluid to leave the eye. (See diagram on the next page.) Your doctor may suggest this treatment at any time. Conventional surgery often is done after medicines and laser surgery have failed to control pressure. Conventional surgery, called trabeculectomy, is performed in an operating room. Before the surgery, you are given medicine to help you relax. Your doctor makes small injections around the eye to numb it. A small piece of tissue is removed to create a new channel for the fluid to drain from the eye. This fluid will drain between the eye tissue layers and create a blister-like \"filtration bleb.\" For several weeks after the surgery, you must put drops in the eye to fight infection and inflammation. These drops will be different from those you may have been using before surgery. Conventional surgery is performed on one eye at a time. Usually the operations are four to six weeks apart. Conventional surgery is about 60 to 80 percent effective at lowering eye pressure. If the new drainage opening narrows, a second operation may be needed. Conventional surgery works best if you have not had previous eye surgery, such as a cataract operation. Sometimes after conventional surgery, your vision may not be as good as it was before conventional surgery. Conventional surgery can cause side effects, including cataract, problems with the cornea, inflammation, infection inside the eye, or low eye pressure problems. If you have any of these problems, tell your doctor so a treatment plan can be developed. What are some other forms of glaucoma and how are they treated? Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form. Some people have other types of the disease. In <strong>low-tension</strong> or <strong>normal-tension glaucoma</strong>, optic nerve damage and narrowed side vision occur in people with normal eye pressure. Lowering eye pressure at least 30 percent through medicines slows the disease in some people. Glaucoma may worsen in others despite low pressures. A comprehensive medical history is important to identify other potential risk factors, such as low blood pressure, that contribute to low-tension glaucoma. If no risk factors are identified, the treatment options for low-tension glaucoma are the same as for open-angle glaucoma. In <strong>angle-closure glaucoma</strong>, the fluid at the front of the eye cannot drain through the angle and leave the eye. The angle gets blocked by part of the iris. People with this type of glaucoma may have a sudden increase in eye pressure. Symptoms include severe pain and nausea, as well as redness of the eye and blurred vision. If you have these symptoms, you need to seek treatment immediately. <strong>This is a medical emergency.</strong> If your doctor is unavailable, go to the nearest hospital or clinic. Without treatment to restore the flow of fluid, the eye can become blind. Usually, prompt laser surgery and medicines can clear the blockage, lower eye pressure, and protect vision. In <strong>congenital glaucoma</strong>, children are born with a defect in the angle of the eye that slows the normal drainage of fluid. These children usually have obvious symptoms, such as cloudy eyes, sensitivity to light, and excessive tearing. Conventional surgery typically is the suggested treatment, because medicines are not effective and can cause more serious side effects in infants and be difficult to administer. Surgery is safe and effective. If surgery is done promptly, these children usually have an excellent chance of having good vision. Conventional surgery makes a new opening for the fluid to leave the eye. <strong>Secondary glaucomas</strong> can develop as complications of other medical conditions. For example, a severe form of glaucoma is called <strong>neovascular glaucoma</strong>, and can be a result from poorly controlled diabetes or high blood pressure. Other types of glaucoma sometimes occur with cataract, certain eye tumors, or when the eye is inflamed or irritated by a condition called uveitis. Sometimes glaucoma develops after other eye surgeries or serious eye injuries. Steroid drugs used to treat eye inflammations and other diseases can trigger glaucoma in some people. There are two eye conditions known to cause secondary forms of glaucoma. <strong>Pigmentary glaucoma</strong> occurs when pigment from the iris sheds off and blocks the meshwork, slowing fluid drainage. <strong>Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma</strong> occurs when extra material is produced and shed off internal eye structures and blocks the meshwork, again slowing fluid drainage. Depending on the cause of these secondary glaucomas, treatment includes medicines, laser surgery, or conventional or other glaucoma surgery. What research is being done? Through studies in the laboratory and with patients, NEI is seeking better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with glaucoma. For example, researchers have discovered genes that could help explain how glaucoma damages the eye. NEI also is supporting studies to learn more about who is likely to get glaucoma, when to treat people who have increased eye pressure, and which treatment to use first. What You Can Do If you are being treated for glaucoma, be sure to take your glaucoma medicine every day. See your eye care professional regularly. You also can help protect the vision of family members and friends who may be at high risk for glaucoma-African Americans over age 40; everyone over age 60, especially Mexican Americans; and people with a family history of the disease. Encourage them to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once every two years. Remember that lowering eye pressure in the early stages of glaucoma slows progression of the disease and helps save vision. Medicare covers an annual comprehensive dilated eye exam for some people at high risk for glaucoma. These people include those with diabetes, those with a family history of glaucoma, and African Americans age 50 and older. What should I ask my eye care professional? You can protect yourself against vision loss by working in partnership with your eye care professional. Ask questions and get the information you need to take care of yourself and your family. What are some questions to ask? <strong>About my eye disease or disorder...</strong> <li>What is my diagnosis?</li> <li>What caused my condition?</li> <li>Can my condition be treated?</li> <li>How will this condition affect my vision now and in the future?</li> <li>Should I watch for any particular symptoms and notify you if they occur?</li> <li>Should I make any lifestyle changes?</li> <strong>About my treatment...</strong> <li>What is the treatment for my condition?</li> <li>When will the treatment start and how long will it last?</li> <li>What are the benefits of this treatment and how successful is it?</li> <li>What are the risks and side effects associated with this treatment?</li> <li>Are there foods, medicines, or activities I should avoid while I'm on this treatment?</li> <li>If my treatment includes taking medicine, what should I do if I miss a dose?</li> <li>Are other treatments available?</li> <strong>About my tests...</strong> <li>What kinds of tests will I have?</li> <li>What can I expect to find out from these tests?</li> <li>When will I know the results?</li> <li>Do I have to do anything special to prepare for any of the tests?</li> <li>Do these tests have any side effects or risks?</li> <li>Will I need more tests later?</li> <strong>Other suggestions</strong> <li>If you don't understand your eye care professional's responses, ask questions until you do understand.</li> <li>Take notes or get a friend or family member to take notes for you. Or, bring a tape recorder to help you remember the discussion.</li> <li>Ask your eye care professional to write down his or her instructions to you.</li> <li>Ask your eye care professional for printed material about your condition.</li> <li>If you still have trouble understanding your eye care professional's answers, ask where you can go for more information.</li> <li>Other members of your healthcare team, such as nurses and pharmacists, can be good sources of information. Talk to them, too.</li> Today, patients take an active role in their health care. Be an active patient about your eye care. Loss of Vision If you have lost some sight from glaucoma, ask your eye care professional about low vision services and devices that may help you make the most of your remaining vision. Ask for a referral to a specialist in low vision. Many community organizations and agencies offer information about low vision counseling, training, and other special services for people with visual impairments. How should I use my glaucoma eyedrops? If eyedrops have been prescribed for treating your glaucoma, you need to use them properly, as instructed by your eye care professional. Proper use of your glaucoma medication can improve the medicine's effectiveness and reduce your risk of side effects. To properly apply your eyedrops, follow these steps: <li>Wash your hands.</li> <li>Hold the bottle upside down.</li> <li>Tilt your head back.</li> <li>Hold the bottle in one hand and place it as close as possible to the eye.</li> <li>With the other hand, pull down your lower eyelid. This forms a pocket.</li> <li>Place the prescribed number of drops into the lower eyelid pocket. If you are using more than one eyedrop, be sure to wait at least 5 minutes before applying the second eyedrop.</li> <li>Close your eye OR press the lower lid lightly with your finger for at least 1 minute. Either of these steps keeps the drops in the eye and helps prevent the drops from draining into the tear duct, which can increase your risk of side effects.</li> ",

                "document": " Scoliosis Spinal curvature Infantile scoliosis Juvenile scoliosis Summary Scoliosis is an abnormal curving of the spine. Your spine is your backbone. It runs straight down your back. Everyone's spine naturally curves a bit. But people with scoliosis have a spine that curves too much. The spine might look like the letter C or S. Causes Most of the time, the cause of scoliosis is unknown. This is called idiopathic scoliosis. It is the most common type. It is grouped by age. In children age 3 and younger, it is called infantile scoliosis. In children age 4 through 10, it is called juvenile scoliosis. In children age 11 through 18, it is called adolescent scoliosis. Scoliosis most often affects girls. Some people are more likely to have curving of the spine. Curving generally gets worse during a growth spurt. Other types of scoliosis are: Congenital scoliosis: This type of scoliosis is present at birth. It occurs when the baby's ribs or spine bones do not form properly. Neuromuscular scoliosis: This type is caused by a nervous system problem that affects the muscles. Problems can include cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, and polio. Symptoms Most often, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they may include: Backache or low-back pain that goes down the legs Weakness or tired feeling in the spine after sitting or standing for a long time Uneven hips or shoulders (one shoulder may be higher than the other) Spine curves more to one side Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam. You will be asked to bend forward. This makes your spine easier to see. It may be hard to see changes in the early stages of scoliosis. The exam may show: One shoulder is higher than the other The pelvis is tilted X-rays of the spine are done. X-rays are important because the actual curving of the spine may be worse than what your doctor can see during an exam. Other tests may include: Spinal curve measurement (scoliometer screening) MRI of the spine CT scan of the spine to look at the bony changes Treatment Treatment depends on many things: The cause of scoliosis Where the curve is in your spine How big the curve is If your body is still growing Most people with idiopathic scoliosis do not need treatment. But you should still be checked by a doctor about every 6 months. If you are still growing, your doctor might recommend a back brace. A back brace prevents further curving. There are many different types of braces. What kind you get depends on the size and location of your curve. Your provider will pick the best one for you and show you how to use it. Back braces can be adjusted as you grow. Back braces work best in people over age 10. Braces do not work for those with congenital or neuromuscular scoliosis. You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly. Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible: Surgery is done with a cut through the back, belly area, or beneath the ribs. The spine bones are held in place with 1 or 2 metal rods. The rods are held down with hooks and screws until the bone heals together. After surgery, you may need to wear a brace for a while to keep the spine still. Scoliosis treatment may also include: Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace. Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly. Support Groups Seek support and more information from organizations that specialize in scoliosis. Outlook (Prognosis) How well a person with scoliosis does depends on the type, cause, and severity of the curve. The more severe the curving, the more likely it will get worse after the child stops growing. People with mild scoliosis do well with braces. They usually do not have long-term problems. Back pain may be more likely when the person gets older. Outlook for those with neuromuscular or congenital scoliosis varies. They may have another serious disorder, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy, so their goals are much different. Often, the goal of surgery is simply to allow a child to be able to sit upright in a wheelchair. Congenital scoliosis is difficult to treat and usually requires many surgeries. Possible Complications Complications of scoliosis can include: Breathing problems (in severe scoliosis) Low back pain Lower self-esteem Persistent pain if there is wear and tear of the spine bones Spinal infection after surgery Spine or nerve damage from an uncorrected curve or spinal surgery Leakage of spinal fluid When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if you suspect your child may have scoliosis. Prevention Routine scoliosis screening is now done in middle schools. Such screening has helped detect early scoliosis in many children. Review Date 9/7/2017 Updated by: C.

                "document": " Knock knees Genu valgum Summary Knock knees are condition in which the knees touch, but the ankles do not touch. The legs turn inward. Causes Infants start out with bowlegs because of their folded position while in their mother's womb. The legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk (at about 12 to 18 months). By age 3, the child becomes knock-kneed. When the child stands, the knees touch but the ankles are apart. By puberty, the legs straighten out and most children can stand with the knees and ankles touching (without forcing the position). Knock knees can also develop as a result of a medical problem or disease, such as: Injury of the shinbone (only one leg will be knock-kneed) Osteomyelitis (bone infection) Overweight or obesity Rickets (a disease caused by a lack of vitamin D) Exams and Tests A health care provider will examine your child. Tests will be done if there are signs that knock knees are not a part of normal development. Treatment Knock knees are not treated in most cases. If the problem continues after age 7, the child may use a night brace. This brace is attached to a shoe. Surgery may be considered for knock knees that are severe and continue beyond late childhood. Outlook (Prognosis) Children normally outgrow knock knees without treatment, unless it is caused by a disease. If surgery is needed, the results are most often good. Possible Complications Complications may include: Difficulty walking (very rare) Self-esteem changes related to cosmetic appearance of knock knees If left untreated, knock knees can lead to early arthritis of the knee When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if you think your child has knock knees. Prevention There is no known prevention for normal knock knees. Review Date 12/9/2016 Updated by: Neil K.

                "document": " Lichen planus Summary Lichen planus is a condition that forms an itchy rash on the skin or in the mouth. Causes The exact cause of lichen planus is unknown. It may be related to an allergic or immune reaction. Risks for the condition include: Exposure to certain medicines, dyes, and other chemicals (including gold, antibiotics, arsenic, iodides, chloroquine, quinacrine, quinide, phenothiazines, and diuretics) Diseases such as hepatitis C Lichen planus mostly affects middle-aged adults. It is less common in children. Symptoms Mouth sores are one symptom of lichen planus. They: May be tender or painful (mild cases may not cause pain) Are located on the sides of the tongue, inside of the cheek, or on the gums Look like bluish-white spots or pimples Form lines in a lacy network Gradually increase in size Sometimes form painful ulcers Skin sores are another symptom of lichen planus. They: Usually appear on the inner wrist, legs, torso, or genitals Are itchy Have even sides (symmetrical) and sharp borders Occur alone or in clusters, often at the site of a skin injury May be covered with thin white streaks or scratch marks Are shiny or scaly looking Have a dark, violet color May develop blisters or ulcers Other symptoms of lichen planus are: Dry mouth Hair loss Metallic taste in the mouth Ridges in the nails Exams and Tests Your health care provider may make the diagnosis based on the appearance of your skin or mouth lesions. A skin lesion biopsy or biopsy of a mouth lesion can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and speed healing. If your symptoms are mild, you may not need treatment. Treatments may include: Antihistamines Medicines that calm down the immune system (in severe cases) Lidocaine mouthwashes to numb the area and make eating more comfortable (for mouth sores) Topical corticosteroids or oral corticosteroids to reduce swelling and lower immune responses Corticosteroid shots into a sore Vitamin A as a cream or taken by mouth Other medicines that are applied to the skin Dressings placed over your skin with medicines to keep you from scratching Ultraviolet light therapy Outlook (Prognosis) Lichen planus is usually not harmful. Most often it gets better with treatment. The condition often clears up within 18 months, but may come and go for years. If lichen planus is caused by a medicine you are taking, the rash should go away once you stop the medicine. Possible Complications Mouth ulcers that are present for a long time may develop into oral cancer. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if: Your skin or mouth lesions change in appearance The condition continues or gets worse, even with treatment Your dentist recommends changing your medicines or treating conditions that trigger the disorder Review Date 10/24/2016 Updated by: David L.

                "document": " Iron overdose Ferrous sulfate overdose Ferrous gluconate overdose Ferrous fumarate overdose Summary Iron is a mineral found in many over-the-counter supplements. Iron overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this mineral. This can be by accident or on purpose. Iron overdose is especially dangerous for children. A severe overdose can happen if a child eats adult multivitamins, such as prenatal vitamins. If the child eats too many pediatric multivitamins, the effect is usually minor. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an overdose, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient Iron can be harmful in large amounts. Where Found Iron is an ingredient in many mineral and vitamin supplements. Iron supplements are also sold by themselves. Types include: Ferrous sulfate (Feosol, Slow Fe) Ferrous gluconate (Fergon) Ferrous fumarate (Femiron, Feostat) Other products may also contain iron. Symptoms Below are symptoms of an iron overdose in different parts of the body. AIRWAYS AND LUNGS Buildup of fluids in the lungs STOMACH AND INTESTINES Black, and possibly bloody stools Diarrhea Liver damage Metallic taste in mouth Nausea Vomiting blood HEART AND BLOOD Dehydration Low blood pressure Fast and weak pulse Shock NERVOUS SYSTEM Chills Coma (decreased level of consciousness and lack of responsiveness, may occur within 1/2 hour to 1 hour after overdose) Convulsions Dizziness Drowsiness Fever Headache Lack of desire to do anything SKIN Bluish-colored lips and fingernails Flushing Loss of color from the skin (pallor) Note: Symptoms may go away in a few hours, then return again after 1 day or later. Before Calling Emergency Have this information ready: Person's age, weight, and condition Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed If the medicine was prescribed for the person Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room Take the container to the hospital with you, if possible. The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. Tests that may done include: Blood and urine tests, including tests to check iron levels ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) X-ray to detect and track iron tablets through the stomach and intestines Treatment may include: Fluids through a vein (by IV) Medicine to help remove iron from the body and treat symptoms Endoscopy -- camera and tube placed down the throat to view the esophagus and the stomach and to remove pills or stop internal bleeding Whole bowel irrigation with a special solution to quickly flush the iron through the stomach and intestines (taken by mouth or through a tube through the nose into the stomach) Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a breathing machine (ventilator) Outlook (Prognosis) There is a good chance of recovery if the person's symptoms are gone 48 hours after the iron overdose. But, severe liver damage can occur 2 to 5 days after the overdose. Some people have died up to a week after an iron overdose. The more quickly the person receives treatment, the better the chance for survival. Iron overdose can be very severe in children. Children may sometimes eat large amounts of iron pills because they look like candy. Many manufacturers have changed their pills so they no longer look like candy.

People affected by this condition may experience a variety of symptoms such as changes in alertness and attention; hallucinations; problems with movement and posture; muscle stiffness; confusion; and/or memory loss. Although the exact cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood, symptoms are thought to result when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein (\"Lewy bodies\") accumulate in the brain. Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, more than one family member may be affected. There is currently no cure for Lewy body dementia; however, medications may be available to help manage the associated symptoms. [1] [2] [3] Symptoms This table lists symptoms that people with this disease may have. For most diseases, symptoms will vary from person to person. People with the same disease may not have all the symptoms listed. This information comes from a database called the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) . The HPO collects information on symptoms that have been described in medical resources. The HPO is updated regularly. Use the HPO ID to access more in-depth information about a symptom.

The symptoms of the condition are thought to occur when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in the regions of the brain involved in thinking, memory and movement. The build-up of these clumps (which are called \"Lewy bodies\") appears to be associated with a loss of certain neurons (nerve cells ) in the brain that produce two important neurotransmitters (chemicals that act as messengers between brain cells). The neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, is important for memory and learning. The other, dopamine, plays an important role in behavior, cognition, movement, motivation, sleep, and mood. [4] Although Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically, more than one family member can rarely be affected. Studies of these families suggest that there may be a genetic component to the condition in some cases. For example, copy number variants or changes ( mutations ) in the SNCA gene have been reported in a few affected families. [5] [6] The APOE epsilon4 allele and mutations in the GBA gene have been associated with an increased risk of Lewy body dementia and the APOE epsilon2 allele with a decreased risk. [5] [7] [2] Inheritance Most cases of Lewy body dementia are not thought to be inherited . The condition generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. [4] Rarely, the condition can affect more than one family member. Some of these cases appear to be due to single gene changes ( mutations ) that follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Other familial cases do not follow a specific pattern of inheritance and likely have a multifactorial cause (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors ). [6] [5] Diagnosis Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person's medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Treatment The Lewy Body Dementia Association offers detailed and up-to-date information regarding the treatment and management of Lewy body dementia .

You may find these specialists through advocacy organizations, clinical trials, or articles published in medical journals. You may also want to contact a university or tertiary medical center in your area, because these centers tend to see more complex cases and have the latest technology and treatments. If you can't find a specialist in your local area, try contacting national or international specialists. They may be able to refer you to someone they know through conferences or research efforts. Some specialists may be willing to consult with you or your local doctors over the phone or by email if you can't travel to them for care. You can find more tips in our guide, How to Find a Disease Specialist. We also encourage you to explore the rest of this page to find resources that can help you find specialists. Healthcare Resources To find a medical professional who specializes in genetics, you can ask your doctor for a referral or you can search for one yourself. Online directories are provided by the American College of Medical Genetics and the National Society of Genetic Counselors. If you need additional help, contact a GARD Information Specialist. You can also learn more about genetic consultations from Genetics Home Reference. ",

                "document": " Cardiac amyloidosis Amyloidosis - cardiac Primary cardiac amyloidosis - AL type Secondary cardiac amyloidosis - AA type Stiff heart syndrome Senile amyloidosis Summary Cardiac amyloidosis is a disorder caused by deposits of an abnormal protein (amyloid) in the heart tissue. These deposits make it hard for the heart to work properly. Causes Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which clumps of proteins called amyloids build up in body tissues. Over time, these proteins replace normal tissue, leading to failure of the involved organ. There are many forms of amyloidosis. Cardiac amyloidosis (\"stiff heart syndrome\") occurs when amyloid deposits take the place of normal heart muscle. It is the most typical type of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac amyloidosis may affect the way electrical signals move through the heart (conduction system). This can lead to abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) and faulty heart signals (heart block). The condition can be inherited. This is called familial cardiac amyloidosis. It can also develop as the result of another disease such as a type of bone and blood cancer, or as the result of another medical problem causing inflammation. Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. The disease is rare in people under age 40. Symptoms Some people may have no symptoms. When present, symptoms may include: Excessive urination at night Fatigue, reduced exercise ability Palpitations (sensation of feeling heartbeat) Shortness of breath with activity Swelling of the abdomen, legs, ankles, or other part of the body Trouble breathing while lying down Exams and Tests The signs of cardiac amyloidosis can be related to a number of different conditions. This can make the problem hard to diagnose. Signs may include: Abnormal sounds in the lung (lung crackles) or a heart murmur Blood pressure that is low or drops when you stand up Enlarged neck veins Swollen liver The following tests may be done: Chest or abdomen CT scan (considered the \"gold standard\" to help diagnose this condition) Coronary angiography Electrocardiogram (ECG) Echocardiogram Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Nuclear heart scans (MUGA, RNV) Positron emission tomography (PET) An ECG may show problems with the heartbeat or heart signals. It may also show low signals (called \"low voltage\"). A cardiac biopsy is used to confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy of another area, such as the abdomen, kidney, or bone marrow, is often done as well. Treatment Your health care provider may tell you to make changes to your diet, including limiting salt and fluids. You may need to take water pills (diuretics) to help your body get rid of excess fluid. The provider may tell you to weigh yourself every day. A weight gain of 3 or more pounds (1 kilogram or more) over 1 to 2 days can mean there is too much fluid in the body. Medicines including digoxin, calcium-channel blockers, and beta-blockers may be used in people with atrial fibrillation. However, the drugs must be used with caution, and the dosage must be carefully monitored. People with cardiac amyloidosis may be extra sensitive to side effects of these drugs. Other treatments may include: Chemotherapy Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) Pacemaker, if there are problems with heart signals Prednisone, an anti-inflammatory medicine A heart transplant may be considered for people with some types of amyloidosis who have very poor heart function. People with hereditary amyloidosis may need a liver transplant. Outlook (Prognosis) In the past, cardiac amyloidosis was thought to be an untreatable and rapidly fatal disease. However, the field is changing rapidly. Different types of amyloidosis can affect the heart in different ways. Some types are more severe than others. Many people can now expect to survive and experience a good quality of life for several years after diagnosis. Possible Complications Complications may include: Atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias Congestive heart failure Fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites) Increased sensitivity to digoxin Low blood pressure and dizziness from excessive urination (due to medicine) Sick sinus syndrome Symptomatic cardiac conduction system disease (arrhythmias related to abnormal conduction of impulses through the heart muscle) When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if you have this disorder and develop new symptoms such as: Dizziness when you change position Excessive weight (fluid) gain Excessive weight loss Fainting spells Severe breathing problems Review Date 5/16/2018 Updated by: Michael A.

People with this condition have particularly short forearms and lower legs and a narrow chest with short ribs. Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is also characterized by the presence of extra fingers and toes (polydactyly), malformed fingernails and toenails, and dental abnormalities. More than half of affected individuals are born with a heart defect, which can cause serious or life-threatening health problems. The features of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome overlap with those of another, milder condition called Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Like Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, Weyers acrofacial dysostosis involves tooth and nail abnormalities, although affected individuals have less pronounced short stature and typically do not have heart defects. The two conditions are caused by mutations in the same genes. Frequency In most parts of the world, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome occurs in 1 in 60,000 to 200,000 newborns. It is difficult to estimate the exact prevalence because the disorder is very rare in the general population. This condition is much more common in the Old Order Amish population of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and in the indigenous (native) population of Western Australia. Causes Ellis-van Creveld syndrome can be caused by mutations in the EVC or EVC2 gene. Little is known about the function of these genes, although they appear to play important roles in cell-to-cell signaling during development. In particular, the proteins produced from the EVC and EVC2 genes are thought to help regulate the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway. This pathway plays roles in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body. The mutations that cause Ellis-van Creveld syndrome result in the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the EVC or EVC2 protein. It is unclear how the defective proteins lead to the specific signs and symptoms of this condition. Studies suggest that they prevent normal Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo, disrupting the formation and growth of the bones, teeth, and other parts of the body. Together, mutations in the EVC and EVC2 genes account for more than half of all cases of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome. The cause of the remaining cases is unknown. Inheritance Pattern This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

                "document": " Oleander poisoning Rosebay poisoning Yellow oleander poisoning Thevetia peruviana poisoning Summary Oleander poisoning occurs when someone eats the flowers or chews the leaves or stems of the oleander plant (<em>Nerium oleander</em>), or its relative, the yellow oleander (<em>Cascabela thevetia</em>). This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient Poisonous ingredients include: Digitoxigenin Neriin Oleandrin Oleondroside <strong>Note:</strong> This list may not include all poisonous ingredients. Where Found The poisonous substances are found in all parts of the oleander plant: Flowers Leaves Stems Twigs Symptoms Oleander poisoning can affect many parts of the body. HEART AND BLOOD Irregular or slow heartbeat Low blood pressure Weakness EYES, EARS, NOSE, MOUTH, AND THROAT Blurred vision Vision disturbances, including halos STOMACH AND INTESTINES Diarrhea Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Stomach pain NERVOUS SYSTEM Confusion Death Depression Disorientation Dizziness Drowsiness Fainting Headache Lethargy SKIN Hives Rash <strong>Note:</strong> Depression, loss of appetite, and halos are most often seen in chronic overdose cases. Home Care Seek immediate medical help. DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care provider. Before Calling Emergency Get the following information: Person's age, weight, and condition Name and part of the plant swallowed, if known Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed Poison Control Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does not need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive: Activated charcoal Blood and urine tests Breathing support Chest x-ray ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) Fluids through a vein (IV) Medicines to treat symptoms including an antidote to reverse the effects of the poison Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (gastric lavage) Outlook (Prognosis) How well you do depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster you get medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Symptoms last for 1 to 3 days and may require a hospital stay. Death is unlikely. DO NOT touch or eat any plant with which you are not familiar. Wash your hands after working in the garden or walking in the woods.

                "document": " Angelman syndrome AS Description Angelman syndrome is a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. Characteristic features of this condition include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and problems with movement and balance (ataxia). Most affected children also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and a small head size (microcephaly). Delayed development becomes noticeable by the age of 6 to 12 months, and other common signs and symptoms usually appear in early childhood. Children with Angelman syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. Hyperactivity, a short attention span, and a fascination with water are common. Most affected children also have difficulty sleeping and need less sleep than usual. With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less excitable, and the sleeping problems tend to improve. However, affected individuals continue to have intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and seizures throughout their lives. Adults with Angelman syndrome have distinctive facial features that may be described as \"coarse.\" Other common features include unusually fair skin with light-colored hair and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). The life expectancy of people with this condition appears to be nearly normal. Frequency Angelman syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 people. Causes Many of the characteristic features of Angelman syndrome result from the loss of function of a gene called UBE3A. People normally inherit one copy of the UBE3A gene from each parent. Both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body's tissues. In certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active. This parent-specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. If the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene mutation, a person will have no active copies of the gene in some parts of the brain. Several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. Most cases of Angelman syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. In other cases (about 11 percent), Angelman syndrome is caused by a mutation in the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. In a small percentage of cases, Angelman syndrome results when a person inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father (paternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. This phenomenon is called paternal uniparental disomy. Rarely, Angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect in the region of DNA that controls activation of the UBE3A gene. These genetic changes can abnormally turn off (inactivate) UBE3A or other genes on the maternal copy of chromosome 15. The causes of Angelman syndrome are unknown in 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals. Changes involving other genes or chromosomes may be responsible for the disorder in these cases. In some people who have Angelman syndrome, the loss of a gene called OCA2 is associated with light-colored hair and fair skin. The OCA2 gene is located on the segment of chromosome 15 that is often deleted in people with this disorder. However, loss of the OCA2 gene does not cause the other signs and symptoms of Angelman syndrome. The protein produced from this gene helps determine the coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Inheritance Pattern Most cases of Angelman syndrome are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 or by paternal uniparental disomy. These genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, a genetic change responsible for Angelman syndrome can be inherited. For example, it is possible for a mutation in the UBE3A gene or in the nearby region of DNA that controls gene activation to be passed from one generation to the next.

Pain may also be felt in the right shoulder, and can be confused with heartburn, gallbladder pain, a stomach virus, or kicking by the baby. Not urinating very often. Nausea and vomiting (a worrisome sign). Vision changes, including temporary blindness, seeing flashing lights or spots, sensitivity to light, and blurry vision. Feel lightheaded or faint. Exams and Tests The health care provider will do a physical exam. This may show: High blood pressure, often higher than 140/90 mm Hg Swelling in the hands and face Weight gain Blood and urine tests will be done. This may show: Protein in the urine (proteinuria) Higher-than-normal liver enzymes Platelet count that is low Higher-than-normal creatinine levels in your blood Tests will also be done to: See how well your blood clots Monitor the baby's health The results of a pregnancy ultrasound, non-stress test, and other tests will help your provider decide whether your baby needs to be delivered right away. Women who had low blood pressure at the start of their pregnancy, followed by a significant rise in blood pressure need to be watched closely for other signs of preeclampsia. Treatment Preeclampsia often resolves after the baby is born and the placenta is delivered. However, it may persist or even begin after delivery. Most often, at 37 weeks, your baby is developed enough to be healthy outside of the womb. As a result, your provider will likely want your baby to be delivered so the preeclampsia does not get worse. You may get medicines to help trigger labor, or you may need a C-section. If your baby is not fully developed and you have mild preeclampsia, the disease can often be managed at home until your baby has matured. The provider will recommend: Frequent doctor visits to make sure you and your baby are doing well. Medicines to lower your blood pressure (sometimes). The severity of preeclampsia may change quickly, so you'll need very careful follow-up. Complete bed rest is no longer recommended. Sometimes, a pregnant woman with preeclampsia is admitted to the hospital. This allows the health care team to watch the baby and mother more closely. Treatment in the hospital may include: Close monitoring of the mother and baby Medicines to control blood pressure and prevent seizures and other complications Steroid injections for pregnancies under 34 weeks gestation to help speed up the development of the baby's lungs You and your provider will continue to discuss the safest time to deliver your baby, considering: How close you are to your due date. The severity of the preeclampsia. Preeclampsia has many severe complications that can harm the mother. How well the baby is doing in the womb. The baby must be delivered if there are signs of severe preeclampsia. These include: Tests that show your baby is not growing well or is not getting enough blood and oxygen. The bottom number of your blood pressure is over 110 mm Hg or is greater than 100 mm Hg consistently over a 24-hour period. Abnormal liver function test results. Severe headaches. Pain in the belly area (abdomen). Seizures or changes in mental function (eclampsia). Fluid buildup in the mother's lungs. HELLP syndrome (rare). Low platelet count or bleeding. Low urine output, a lot of protein in the urine, and other signs that your kidneys are not working properly. Outlook (Prognosis) Sign and symptoms of preeclampsia most often go away within 6 weeks after delivery. However, the high blood pressure sometimes gets worse the first few days after delivery. You are still at risk for preeclampsia for up to 6 weeks after delivery. This postpartum preeclampsia carries a higher risk of death. If you notice any symptoms of preeclampsia, contact your health care provider right away. If you have had preeclampsia, you are more likely to develop it again during another pregnancy. In most cases, it is not as severe as the first time. If you have high blood pressure during more than one pregnancy, you are more likely to have high blood pressure when you get older. Possible Complications Rare but severe immediate complications for the mother can include: Bleeding problems Seizure (eclampsia) Fetal growth retardation Premature separation of the placenta from the uterus before the baby is born Rupture of the liver Stroke Death (rarely) Having a history of preeclampsia makes a woman a higher risk for future problems such as: Heart disease Diabetes Kidney disease When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if you have symptoms of preeclampsia during your pregnancy or after delivery. Prevention There is no sure way to prevent preeclampsia. If your doctor thinks you are at high risk of developing preeclampsia, they may suggest that you start baby aspirin (81 mg) daily late in the first trimester or early in the second trimester of your pregnancy. However, DO NOT start baby aspirin unless you have consulted with your doctor first. If your doctor thinks your calcium intake is low, they may suggest that you take a calcium supplement daily. There are no other specific preventive measures for preeclampsia. It is important for all pregnant women to start prenatal care early and continue it through the pregnancy and after delivery.

                "document": " Multiple sclerosis Overview Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. Eventually, the disease can cause the nerves themselves to deteriorate or become permanently damaged. Signs and symptoms of MS vary widely and depend on the amount of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some people with severe MS may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms. There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, treatments can help speed recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms. Find out why Mayo Clinic is the best place for your care. Symptoms Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms may differ greatly from person to person and over the course of the disease depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. They may include: - Numbness or weakness in one or more limbs that typically occurs on one side of your body at a time, or the legs and trunk - Partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time, often with pain during eye movement - Prolonged double vision - Tingling or pain in parts of your body - Electric-shock sensations that occur with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward (Lhermitte sign) - Tremor, lack of coordination or unsteady gait - Slurred speech - Fatigue - Dizziness - Problems with bowel and bladder function When to see a doctor See a doctor if you experience any of the above symptoms for unknown reasons. Disease course Most people with MS have a relapsing-remitting disease course. They experience periods of new symptoms or relapses that develop over days or weeks and usually improve partially or completely. These relapses are followed by quiet periods of disease remission that can last months or even years. Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen signs and symptoms of MS, but these aren't considered disease relapses. About 60 to 70 percent of people with relapsing-remitting MS eventually develop a steady progression of symptoms, with or without periods of remission, known as secondary-progressive MS. The worsening of symptoms usually includes problems with mobility and gait. The rate of disease progression varies greatly among people with secondary-progressive MS. Some people with MS experience a gradual onset and steady progression of signs and symptoms without any relapses. This is known as primary-progressive MS. Causes The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown. It's considered an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. In the case of MS, this immune system malfunction destroys myelin (the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord). Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires. When the protective myelin is damaged and nerve fiber is exposed, the messages that travel along that nerve may be slowed or blocked. The nerve may also become damaged itself. It isn't clear why MS develops in some people and not others. A combination of genetics and environmental factors appears to be responsible. Risk factors These factors may increase your risk of developing multiple sclerosis: - Age. MS can occur at any age, but most commonly affects people between the ages of 15 and 60. - Sex. Women are about twice as likely as men are to develop MS. - Family history. If one of your parents or siblings has had MS, you are at higher risk of developing the disease. - Certain infections. A variety of viruses have been linked to MS, including Epstein-Barr, the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis. - Race. White people, particularly those of Northern European descent, are at highest risk of developing MS. People of Asian, African or Native American descent have the lowest risk. - Climate. MS is far more common in countries with temperate climates, including Canada, the northern United States, New Zealand, southeastern Australia and Europe. - Certain autoimmune diseases. You have a slightly higher risk of developing MS if you have thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease. - Smoking. Smokers who experience an initial event of symptoms that may signal MS are more likely than nonsmokers to develop a second event that confirms relapsing-remitting MS. Diagnosis There are no specific tests for MS. Instead, a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis often relies on ruling out other conditions that might produce similar signs and symptoms, known as a differential diagnosis. Your doctor is likely to start with a thorough medical history and examination. Your doctor may then recommend: - Blood tests, to help rule out other diseases with symptoms similar to MS. Tests to check for specific biomarkers associated with MS are currently under development and may also aid in diagnosing the disease. - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap), in which a small sample of fluid is removed from your spinal canal for laboratory analysis. This sample can show abnormalities in antibodies that are associated with MS. Spinal tap can also help rule out infections and other conditions with symptoms similar to MS. - MRI, which can reveal areas of MS (lesions) on your brain and spinal cord. You may receive an intravenous injection of a contrast material to highlight lesions that indicate your disease is in an active phase. - Evoked potential tests, which record the electrical signals produced by your nervous system in response to stimuli. An evoked potential test may use visual stimuli or electrical stimuli, in which you watch a moving visual pattern, or short electrical impulses are applied to nerves in your legs or arms. Electrodes measure how quickly the information travels down your nerve pathways. In most people with relapsing-remitting MS, the diagnosis is fairly straightforward and based on a pattern of symptoms consistent with the disease and confirmed by brain imaging scans, such as MRI. Diagnosing MS can be more difficult in persons with unusual symptoms or progressive disease. In these cases, further testing with spinal fluid analysis, evoked potentials and additional imaging may be needed. Treatment There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing MS symptoms. Some people have such mild symptoms that no treatment is necessary. Treatments for MS attacks - Corticosteroids, such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed to reduce nerve inflammation. Side effects may include insomnia, increased blood pressure, mood swings and fluid retention. - Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then mixed with a protein solution (albumin) and put back into your body. Plasma exchange may be used if your symptoms are new, severe and haven't responded to steroids. Treatments to modify progression For primary-progressive MS, ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy. It slows worsening of disability in people with this type of MS. For relapsing-remitting MS, several disease-modifying therapies are available. Much of the immune response associated with MS occurs in the early stages of the disease. Aggressive treatment with these medications as early as possible can lower the relapse rate and slow the formation of new lesions. Many of the disease-modifying therapies used to treat MS carry significant health risks. Selecting the right therapy for you will depend on careful consideration of many factors, including duration and severity of disease, effectiveness of previous MS treatments, other health issues, cost, and child-bearing status. Treatment options for relapsing-remitting MS include: - Beta interferons. These medications are among the most commonly prescribed medications to treat MS. They are injected under the skin or into muscle and can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Side effects of beta interferons may include flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions. You'll need blood tests to monitor your liver enzymes because liver damage is a possible side effect of interferon use. People taking interferons may develop neutralizing antibodies that can reduce drug effectiveness. - Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus). This humanized immunoglobulin antibody medication is the only DMT approved by the FDA to treat both the relapse-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS. Clinical trials showed it reduced relapse rate in relapsing disease and slowed worsening of disability in both forms of the disease. Ocrevus is given via an intravenous infusion by a medical professional. Side effects may infusion-related reactions including irritation at the injection site, low blood pressure, fever, and nausea among others. Ocrevus may also increase the risk of some types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. - Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). This medication may help block your immune system's attack on myelin and must be injected beneath the skin. Side effects may include skin irritation at the injection site. - Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera). This twice-daily oral medication can reduce relapses. Side effects may include flushing, diarrhea, nausea and lowered white blood cell count. - Fingolimod (Gilenya). This once-daily oral medication reduces relapse rate. You'll need to have your heart rate monitored for six hours after the first dose because your heartbeat may be slowed. Other side effects include headache, high blood pressure and blurred vision. - Teriflunomide (Aubagio). This once-daily medication can reduce relapse rate. Teriflunomide can cause liver damage, hair loss and other side effects. It is harmful to a developing fetus and should not be used by women who may become pregnant and are not using appropriate contraception, or their male partner. - Natalizumab (Tysabri). This medication is designed to block the movement of potentially damaging immune cells from your bloodstream to your brain and spinal cord. It may be considered a first line treatment for some people with severe MS or as a second line treatment in others. This medication increases the risk of a viral infection of the brain called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in some people. - Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada). This drug helps reduce relapses of MS by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells, but it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by another three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions are common with alemtuzumab. The drug is only available from registered providers, and people treated with the drug must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. - Mitoxantrone. This immunosuppressant drug can be harmful to the heart and is associated with development of blood cancers. As a result, its use in treating MS is extremely limited. Mitoxantrone is usually used only to treat severe, advanced MS. Treatments for MS signs and symptoms - Physical therapy. A physical or occupational therapist can teach you stretching and strengthening exercises and show you how to use devices to make it easier to perform daily tasks. Physical therapy along with the use of a mobility aid when necessary can also help manage leg weakness and other gait problems often associated with MS. - Muscle relaxants. You may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in your legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) may help. - Medications to reduce fatigue. - Other medications. Medications also may be prescribed for depression, pain, sexual dysfunction, and bladder or bowel control problems that are associated with MS. Lifestyle and home remedies To help relieve the signs and symptoms of MS, try to: - Get plenty of rest. - Exercise. If you have mild to moderate MS, regular exercise can help improve your strength, muscle tone, balance and coordination. Swimming or other water exercises are good options if you're bothered by heat. Other types of mild to moderate exercise recommended for people with MS include walking, stretching, low-impact aerobics, stationary bicycling, yoga and tai chi. - Cool down. MS symptoms often worsen when your body temperature rises. Avoiding exposure to heat and using devices such as cooling scarves or vests can be helpful. - Eat a balanced diet. Results of small studies suggest that a diet low in saturated fat but high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in olive and fish oils, may be beneficial. But further research is needed. Studies also suggest that vitamin D may have potential benefit for people with MS. - Relieve stress. Stress may trigger or worsen your signs and symptoms. Yoga, tai chi, massage, meditation or deep breathing may help. Alternative medicine Many people with MS use a variety of alternative or complementary treatments or both to help manage their symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle pain. Activities such as exercise, meditation, yoga, massage, eating a healthier diet, acupuncture and relaxation techniques may help boost overall mental and physical well-being, but there are few studies to back up their use in managing symptoms of MS. Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology recommend the use of oral cannabis extract for muscle spasticity and pain, but do not recommend cannabis in any other form for other MS symptoms due to a lack of evidence. The guidelines also do not recommend the use of herbal supplements such as Ginkgo biloba and bee venom or magnetic therapy for MS symptoms. ",

                "document": " Skull fracture Basilar skull fracture Depressed skull fracture Linear skull fracture Summary A skull fracture is a fracture or break in the cranial (skull) bones. Considerations Skull fractures may occur with head injuries. The skull provides good protection for the brain. However, a severe impact or blow can cause the skull to break. It may be accompanied by concussion or other injury to the brain. The brain can be affected directly by damage to the nervous system tissue and bleeding. The brain can also be affected by bleeding under the skull. This can compress the underlying brain tissue (subdural or epidural hematoma). A simple fracture is a break in the bone without damage to the skin. A linear skull fracture is a break in a cranial bone resembling a thin line, without splintering, depression, or distortion of bone. A depressed skull fracture is a break in a cranial bone (or \"crushed\" portion of skull) with depression of the bone in toward the brain. A compound fracture involves a break in, or loss of, skin and splintering of the bone. Causes Causes of skull fracture can include: Head trauma Falls, automobile accidents, physical assault, and sports Symptoms Symptoms may include: Bleeding from wound, ears, nose, or around eyes Bruising behind the ears or under the eyes Changes in pupils (sizes unequal, not reactive to light) Confusion Convulsions Difficulties with balance Drainage of clear or bloody fluid from ears or nose Drowsiness Headache Loss of consciousness Nausea and vomiting Restlessness, irritability Slurred speech Stiff neck Swelling Visual disturbances In some cases, the only symptom may be a bump on the head. A bump or bruise may take up to 24 hours to develop. First Aid Take the following steps if you think someone has a skull fracture: <li>Check the airways, breathing, and circulation. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR.</li> <li>Avoid moving the person (unless absolutely necessary) until medical help arrives. Have someone to call 911 (or the local emergency number) for medical assistance.</li> <li>If the person must be moved, take care to stabilize the head and neck. Place your hands on both sides of the head and under the shoulders. Do not allow the head to bend forward or backward, or to twist or turn.</li> <li>Carefully check the site of injury, but do not probe in or around the site with a foreign object. It can be hard to know if the skull is fractured or depressed (dented in) at the site of injury.</li> <li>If there is bleeding, apply firm pressure with a clean cloth over a broad area to control blood loss.</li> <li>If blood soaks through, do not remove the original cloth. Instead, apply more cloths on top, and continue to apply pressure.</li> <li>If the person is vomiting, stabilize the head and neck, and carefully turn the victim to the side to prevent choking on vomit.</li> <li>If the person is conscious and experiencing any of the previously listed symptoms, transport to the nearest emergency medical facility (even if the person does not think medical help is needed).</li> DO NOT Follow these precautions: DO NOT move the person unless absolutely necessary. Head injuries may be associated with spinal injuries. DO NOT remove protruding objects. DO NOT allow the person to continue with physical activities. DO NOT forget to watch the person closely until medical help arrives. DO NOT give the person any medicines before talking to a doctor. DO NOT leave the person alone, even if there are no obvious problems. When to Contact a Medical Professional Get medical help right away if: There are problems with breathing or circulation. Direct pressure does not stop bleeding from the nose, ears, or wound. There is drainage of clear fluid from the nose or ears. There is facial swelling, bleeding, or bruising. There is an object protruding from the skull. The person is unconscious, is experiencing convulsions, has multiple injuries, appears to be in any distress, or cannot think clearly. Prevention Not all head injuries can be prevented. The following simple steps can help keep you and your child safe: <li>Always use safety equipment during activities that could cause a head injury. These include seat belts, bicycle or motorcycle helmets, and hard hats.</li> <li>Learn and follow bicycle safety recommendations.</li> <li>Do not drink and drive. Do not allow yourself to be driven by someone who may have been drinking alcohol or is otherwise impaired. </li> Review Date 10/16/2017 Updated by: Jesse Borke, MD, FACEP, FAAEM, Attending Physician at FDR Medical Services/Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital, Buffalo, NY.

                "document": " Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Limb girdle muscular dystrophy LGMD Summary Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of disorders which affect the voluntary muscles around the hips and shoulders. The conditions are progressive, leading to a loss of muscle strength and bulk over a number of years. Onset may occur in childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, or even later. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. [1] Most forms of limb girdle muscular dystrophy are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Several rare forms are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. [2] While there are no treatments which directly reverse the muscle weakness associated with this condition, supportive treatment can decrease the complications. [3] There are at least 20 different types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. [1] Inheritance Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is most often inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; less commonly, rare sub-types may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. There may be difficulties diagnosing the condition accurately, and often the mode of inheritance cannot be determined. Therefore, it may be challenging to determine the exact recurrence risks for some families. Establishing the type of LGMD in an affected individual can be useful for discussing the clinical course of the disease as well as for determining who else in the family may be at risk for the condition. [4] Diagnosis Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person's medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources Orphanet lists international laboratories offering diagnostic testing for this condition. Treatment Unfortunately, no definitive treatments for LGMD exist. Management depends on each individual and the specific type of LGMD that the individual has. However, the American Academy of Neurology has developed guidelines for treatment of LGMD including: [5] [6] Weight control to avoid obesity Physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent contractures (fixed tightening of the muscles) Use of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobility Monitoring and surgical intervention as needed for orthopedic complications, such as foot deformity and scoliosis cardiomyopathy A team approach to treatment is recommended including a neurologist , pulmonologist , cardiologist , orthopedic surgeon, physiatrist , physical/occupational/ speech therapist , nutritionist , orthopedist , mental health counselors, and geneticist / genetic counselor . [5] [6] While not a currently available treatment option, some studies have shown promising results with the use of gene therapy . More research is needed to prove the safety and efficacy of this treatment approach. [6] Management Guidelines The American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the medical specialty society of neurologists, offers a summary of recommended guidelines for Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Project OrphanAnesthesia is a project whose aim is to create peer-reviewed, readily accessible guidelines for patients with rare diseases and for the anesthesiologists caring for them. The project is a collaborative effort of the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Orphanet, the European Society of Pediatric Anesthesia, anesthetists and rare disease experts with the aim to contribute to patient safety. Related Diseases Related diseases are conditions that have similar signs and symptoms. A health care provider may consider these conditions in the table below when making a diagnosis. Please note that the table may not include all the possible conditions related to this disease. Conditions with similar signs and symptoms from Orphanet The differential diagnosis of LGMD includes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, polymyositis, myotonic, myofibrillar, distal and metabolic myopathy, collagen 6-related disorders and dermatomyosistis.

                "document": " Dehydration Vomiting - dehydration Diarrhea - dehydration Diabetes - dehydration Stomach flu - dehydration Gastroenteritis - dehydration Excessive sweating - dehydration Summary Dehydration occurs when your body does not have as much water and fluids as it needs. Dehydration can be mild, moderate, or severe, based on how much of your body's fluid is lost or not replaced. Severe dehydration is a life-threatening emergency. Causes You can become dehydrated if you lose too much fluid, do not drink enough water or fluids, or both. Your body may lose a lot of fluid from: Sweating too much, for example, from exercising in hot weather Fever Vomiting or diarrhea Urinating too much (uncontrolled diabetes or some medications, like diuretics, can cause you to urinate a lot) You might not drink enough fluids because: You do not feel like eating or drinking because you are sick You are nauseated You have a sore throat or mouth sores Older adults and people with certain diseases, such as diabetes, are also at higher risk for dehydration. Symptoms Signs of mild to moderate dehydration: Thirst Dry or sticky mouth Not urinating much Darker yellow urine Dry, cool skin Headache Muscle cramps Signs of severe dehydration: Not urinating, or very dark yellow or amber-colored urine Dry, shriveled skin Irritability or confusion Dizziness or lightheadedness Rapid heartbeat Rapid breathing Sunken eyes Listlessness Shock (not enough blood flow through the body) Unconsciousness or delirium Exams and Tests Your health care provider will look for these signs of dehydration: Low blood pressure. Blood pressure that drops when you stand up after lying down. White finger tips that do not return to a pink color after your provider presses the fingertip. Skin that is not as elastic as normal. When the provider pinches it into a fold, it may slowly sag back into place. Normally, skin springs back right away. Rapid heart rate. Your provider may do lab tests such as: Blood tests to check kidney function Urine tests to see what may be causing dehydration Other tests to see what may be causing dehydration (blood sugar test for diabetes) Treatment To treat dehydration: Try sipping water or sucking on ice cubes. Try drinking water or sports drinks that contain electrolytes. Do not take salt tablets. They can cause serious complications. Ask your provider what you should eat if you have diarrhea. For more severe dehydration or heat emergency, you may need to stay in a hospital and receive fluid through a vein (IV). The provider will also treat the cause of the dehydration. Dehydration caused by a stomach virus should get better on its own after a few days. Outlook (Prognosis) If you notice signs of dehydration and treat it quickly, you should recover completely. Possible Complications Untreated severe dehydration may cause: Death Permanent brain damage Seizures When to Contact a Medical Professional You should call 911 if: The person loses consciousness at any time. There is any other change in the person's alertness (for example, confusion or seizures). The person has a fever over 102F (38.8C). You notice symptoms of heatstroke (such as rapid pulse or rapid breathing). The person's condition does not improve or gets worse despite treatment. Prevention To prevent dehydration: Drink plenty of fluids every day, even when you are well. Drink more when the weather is hot or you are exercising. If anyone in your family is ill, pay attention to how much they are able to drink. Pay close attention to children and older adults. Anyone with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids. DO NOT wait for signs of dehydration. If you think you or someone in your family may become dehydrated, call your provider. Do this before the person becomes dehydrated. Review Date 9/5/2017 Updated by: Neil K. Kaneshiro, MD, MHA, Clinical Professor of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

                "document": " Typhoid fever Enteric fever Summary Typhoid fever is an infection that causes diarrhea and a rash. It is most commonly caused due to a bacteria called <em>Salmonella typhi</em> (<em>S typhi</em>). Causes <em>S typhi</em> is spread through contaminated food, drink, or water. If you eat or drink something that is contaminated with the bacteria, the bacteria enter your body. They travel into your intestines, and then into your blood. In the blood, they travel to your lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and other parts of the body. Some people become carriers of <em>S typhi</em> and continue to release the bacteria in their stools for years, spreading the disease. Typhoid fever is common in developing countries. Most cases in the United States are brought in from other countries where typhoid fever is common. Symptoms Early symptoms include fever, general ill-feeling, and abdominal pain. High fever (103F, or 39.5C) or higher and severe diarrhea occur as the disease gets worse. Some people develop a rash called \"rose spots,\" which are small red spots on the abdomen and chest. Other symptoms that occur include: Bloody stools Chills Agitation, confusion, delirium, seeing or hearing things that are not there (hallucinations) Difficulty paying attention (attention deficit) Nosebleeds Severe fatigue Slow, sluggish, weak feeling Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms. A complete blood count (CBC) will show a high number of white blood cells. A blood culture during the first week of the fever can show <em>S typhi</em> bacteria. Other tests that can help diagnose this condition include: ELISA blood test to look for antibodies to the <em>S typhi</em> bacteria Fluorescent antibody study to look for substances that are specific to <em>S typhi</em> bacteria Platelet count (platelet count may be low) Stool culture Treatment Fluids and electrolytes may be given by IV (into a vein) or you may be asked to drink water with electrolyte packets. Antibiotics are given to kill the bacteria. There are increasing rates of antibiotic resistance throughout the world, so your provider will check current recommendations before choosing an antibiotic. Outlook (Prognosis) Symptoms usually improve in 2 to 4 weeks with treatment. The outcome is likely to be good with early treatment, but becomes poor if complications develop. Symptoms may return if the treatment has not completely cured the infection. Possible Complications Health problems that may develop include: Intestinal hemorrhage (severe GI bleeding) Intestinal perforation Kidney failure Peritonitis When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have any of the following: You know you have been exposed to someone who has typhoid fever You have been in an area where there are people who have typhoid fever and you develop symptoms of typhoid fever You have had typhoid fever and the symptoms return You develop severe abdominal pain, decreased urine output, or other new symptoms Prevention A vaccine is recommended for travel outside of the United States to places where there is typhoid fever. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has information about where typhoid fever is common -- www.cdc.gov/typhoid-fever/index.html. Ask your provider if you should bring electrolyte packets in case you get sick. When traveling, drink only boiled or bottled water and eat well-cooked food. Wash you hands thoroughly before eating. Water treatment, waste disposal, and protecting the food supply from contamination are important public health measures. Carriers of typhoid must not be allowed to work as food handlers.

                "document": " Williams syndrome Williams-Beuren syndrome Summary Williams syndrome is a rare disorder that can lead to problems with development. Causes Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of several genes. It may be passed down in families. Parents may not have any family history of the condition. However, people with Williams syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. It often occurs randomly. One of the 25 missing genes is the gene that produces elastin, a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition. Symptoms Symptoms of Williams syndrome are: Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing Developmental delay Easily distracted, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Feeding problems including colic, reflux, and vomiting Inward bend of the small finger Learning disorders Mild to moderate intellectual disability Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music Short, compared to the rest of the person's family Sunken chest The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show: A flattened nasal bridge with small upturned nose Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip Prominent lips with an open mouth Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth Exams and Tests Signs include: Narrowing of some blood vessels Farsightedness High blood calcium level that may cause seizures and rigid muscles High blood pressure Slack joints that may change to stiffness as the person gets older Unusual star-like pattern in iris of the eye Tests for Williams syndrome include: Blood pressure check Blood test for a missing piece of chromosome 7 (FISH test) Echocardiography combined with Doppler ultrasound Kidney ultrasound Treatment There is no cure for Williams syndrome. Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium, if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. It is treated based on how severe it is. Physical therapy is helpful to people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other weaknesses. Other treatments are based on the person's symptoms. It can help to have treatment coordinated by a geneticist who is experienced with Williams syndrome. Support Groups A support group can be helpful for emotional support and for giving and receiving practical advice.
